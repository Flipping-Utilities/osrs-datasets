The way <a href=\"/w/Run\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Run\">running</a> works in the game is that every other <a href=\"/w/Game_square\" title=\"Game square\">game square</a> is skipped, since the player moves forward two squares per <a href=\"/w/Tick\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tick\">tick</a>. This means that if that skipped tile happens to be a tile that has some kind of hazard on it, in theory the hazard will never trigger (while in practice, several other mechanics have been put in place to make traps trigger even if the run trick is attempted). The simplest way to guarantee that this skipped tile is the tile that has a trap on it is to make sure to stand still on the tile before the hazard, and then to run past the trap.\n</p><p>Another way to execute the run trick is to plan ahead movements. An area where this is particularly relevant is <a href=\"/w/Rogues%27_Den\" title=\"Rogues&#39; Den\">Rogues' Den</a>. Because of the repetitive nature of the minigame, it may be useful to mark out or memorize specific squares that will allow the player to run for relatively long sections, without having to stop to disarm a trap. To do this, count out the number of tiles between the starting square and the trapped square. Every <b>even</b> tile will be dangerous, while the <b>odd</b> tiles will be skipped. For example, when standing right next to a square with a trap, the next square having no trap, and then the third tile being trapped again, and so forth, then those traps are safe to run past in a single go, without needing to stop in between.\n</p><p>The trick is also very useful to speed up completion of the <a href=\"/w/Hallowed_Sepulchre\" title=\"Hallowed Sepulchre\">Hallowed Sepulchre</a>, in particular the lower floors where the susceptible lightning strikes are more commonly found. Using the run trick makes it possible to shave off several seconds for each series of lightning strikes. It is highly recommended players use their first run through the dungeon to take note of which square to start running from, in order to avoid getting hit by the lightning strikes. Doing so can allow players to run long stretches through several dangerous fields of lightning, without getting hit a single time.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Do's\">Do's</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/Run_trick?section=2&amp;veaction=edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: Do&#039;s\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/w/Run_trick?action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Do&#039;s\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:218px;\"><a href=\"/w/File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_corner_tricking.gif\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/Monkey_Madness_II_-_corner_tricking.gif?cc833\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"216\" height=\"168\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-file-width=\"216\" data-file-height=\"168\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\">A player using a run trick on the <a href=\"/w/Monkey_Madness_II\" title=\"Monkey Madness II\">Monkey Madness II</a> monkey guards.</div></div></div>\n<p>The run trick works in a few situations in varying locations.\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/w/Wall_Beast\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Wall Beast\">Wall Beasts</a> can be completely avoided without the need for a <a href=\"/w/Spiny_helmet\" title=\"Spiny helmet\">spiny helmet</a>.</li>\n<li>All traps in the <a href=\"/w/Rogues%27_Den\" title=\"Rogues&#39; Den\">Rogues' Den</a> minigame allow for this trick.

It can be considered a form of [[tick manipulation]]. The trick makes use of the fact running moves the player forward by two [[game square]]s in a single game tick, meaning that the game effectively never considers the player to be on the square that would trigger an event to happen.\n\nEven though this trick is generally effective on older content, newer content or content that has been reworked more recently will typically have mechanics in place that prevent players from using this mechanic. Notably, the [[Underground Pass]] dungeon used to feature several traps that would allow the run trick to be used, but after the release of [[Song of the Elves]], an undocumented update changed the dungeon to no longer allow this.\n\n== How to execute ==\n{{Incomplete|Needs a clear animation of the run trick being executed on a trap.}}\n\nThe run trick works by ensuring the player character is never considered to be on a certain tile. The way [[run]]ning works in the game is that every other [[game square]] is skipped, since the player moves forward two squares per [[tick]]. This means that if that skipped tile happens to be a tile that has some kind of hazard on it, in theory the hazard will never trigger (while in practice, several other mechanics have been put in place to make traps trigger even if the run trick is attempted). The simplest way to guarantee that this skipped tile is the tile that has a trap on it is to make sure to stand still on the tile before the hazard, and then to run past the trap.\n\nAnother way to execute the run trick is to plan ahead movements. An area where this is particularly relevant is [[Rogues' Den]]. Because of the repetitive nature of the minigame, it may be useful to mark out or memorize specific squares that will allow the player to run for relatively long sections, without having to stop to disarm a trap. To do this, count out the number of tiles between the starting square and the trapped square. Every '''even''' tile will be dangerous, while the '''odd''' tiles will be skipped. For example, when standing right next to a square with a trap, the next square having no trap, and then the third tile being trapped again, and so forth, then those traps are safe to run past in a single go, without needing to stop in between.\n\nThe trick is also very useful to speed up completion of the [[Hallowed Sepulchre]], in particular the lower floors where the susceptible lightning strikes are more commonly found. Using the run trick makes it possible to shave off several seconds for each series of lightning strikes. It is highly recommended players use their first run through the dungeon to take note of which square to start running from, in order to avoid getting hit by the lightning strikes. Doing so can allow players to run long stretches through several dangerous fields of lightning, without getting hit a single time.\n\n== Do's ==\n[[File:Monkey Madness II - corner tricking.gif|frame|A player using a run trick on the [[Monkey Madness II]] monkey guards.]]\nThe run trick works in a few situations in varying locations.\n* [[Wall Beast]]s can be completely avoided without the need for a [[spiny helmet]].\n* All traps in the [[Rogues' Den]] minigame allow for this trick. However, the trick only guarantees to avoid damage if the square behind the trap does not contain another trap.\n* This trick can be used to avoid two traps in the [[Hallowed Sepulchre]]. The lightning traps can be completely avoided because every lightning tile is always surrounded by safe tiles. The teleportation tiles sometimes have safe tiles adjacent, but this is not always the case. As such, when approaching sets of teleportation tiles it is recommended to stop immediately in front of them, and then move through a series that takes advantage of the run trick while minimizing the amount of yellow tiles in the series to reduce bad outcomes when the teleportation tiles change state. More information can be found on the [[Hallowed Sepulchre/Strategies|Hallowed Sepulchre strategy guide]]. These are the only two traps in the activity that make use of the run trick. \n* The [[Ape Atoll Dungeon]] featured in [[Monkey Madness I]] contains a few traps in the floor, particularly around the [[skeleton monkey]]s and in the westernmost and northernmost areas, that can be avoided altogether.\n* [[Tarn's Lair]] features some floor traps that can be completely avoided by using the run trick. However, most of these traps can also simply be avoided by running around them, and serve mostly as an extra damage source to inattentive players.\n*In the [[Miscellania and Etceteria Dungeon]] navigated during the [[Royal Trouble]] quest:\n**The slippery rock obstacles can be passed using this trick instead of using a [[plank]] on them. \n**The more dangerous steam vents can also be passed using the run trick, however players are able to go around the vents.\n* The [[Monkey Madness II]] airship platforms have several patrolling monkeys walking around. Players can walk through the monkeys by using the run trick on a guard that is about to walk around a corner. This ensures that the player is never in the guard's line of sight. See the quest guide for more information.\n* Stationary blood splats in the fight with [[The Maiden of Sugadinti]] can be run across using the run trick to avoid damage, and to avoid healing the Maiden.\n* Tornadoes summoned by both [[Hunllef]] and [[Lady Verzik Vitur]], as well as lightning and acid pools summoned by the [[Great Olm]], can be crossed without taking damage by using the run trick.\n\n== Don'ts ==\n\nSeveral areas do not allow players to avoid traps using the run trick. Attempting to use the run trick will still trigger the trap, causing the effects of the trap to be applied to the player, such as damaging, inflicting poison, or other effects.\n\n* [[Brimhaven Agility Arena]] traps will trigger on the first tile that is entered, pushing the player back to the original side of the trap they were on.

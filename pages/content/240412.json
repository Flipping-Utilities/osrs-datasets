Ironmen have to do activities that specifically generate <i><a href=\"/w/Coins\" title=\"Coins\">coins</a></i> in some way, as they cannot use the <a href=\"/w/Grand_Exchange\" title=\"Grand Exchange\">Grand Exchange</a> to simply trade the items in exchange for coins. For example, a regular account could kill <a href=\"/w/Zulrah\" title=\"Zulrah\">Zulrah</a>, receive a <a href=\"/w/Tanzanite_fang\" title=\"Tanzanite fang\">tanzanite fang</a> and then sell it to the Grand Exchange for <span class=\"coins coins-1000 coins-pos\">3,129,785</span> and the player would have that amount in coins, but an Ironman would only get 66,000 coins from its High Alchemy value.\n</p><p>Because of the restrictions Ironmen are placed under, many traditional money making methods are difficult or impossible to perform. Most money making methods typically involve casting <a href=\"/w/High_Level_Alchemy\" title=\"High Level Alchemy\">High Level Alchemy</a> to convert items into coins. Players should alch the items while doing other activities which can be done on the normal spellbook, do not require full inventory and have some downtime to cast the spell. Such activities include farm runs, bird house runs, questing, training Agility, training Hunter and melee combat.\n</p><p>At very low levels, players can also sell various alchable items to shops, but once the player can use High Level Alchemy and has the money to buy the nature runes, it is better to alch the items as it generates more profit and it can be done in \"zero time\". Setting level 55 Magic as a short-term goal is therefore recommended for low-level Ironmen.\n</p><p>With 50 <a href=\"/w/Agility\" title=\"Agility\">Agility</a> and <a href=\"/w/Thieving\" title=\"Thieving\">Thieving</a>, players can sell items to <a href=\"/w/Martin_Thwait\" title=\"Martin Thwait\">Martin Thwait</a> in the <a href=\"/w/Rogues%27_Den\" title=\"Rogues&#39; Den\">Rogue's Den</a> for their high alchemy price. The <a href=\"/w/Bandit_Duty_Free\" title=\"Bandit Duty Free\">Wilderness Bandit Camp General Store</a> buys at the same price and has no requirements, but beware of <a href=\"/w/Player_Killers\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Player Killers\">Player Killers</a>. After completing <a href=\"/w/Plague_City\" title=\"Plague City\">Plague City</a>, players can access the <a href=\"/w/West_Ardougne_General_Store\" title=\"West Ardougne General Store\">West Ardougne General Store</a> which buys items for just below their high alchemy price. These stores are useful for players without 55 magic or for selling junk items that aren't worth alching. Specialty stores generally buy items for around their high alchemy price, and often have no requirements.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"General_tips\">General tips</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/Ironman_Moneymaking_Guide?section=1&amp;veaction=edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: General tips\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/w/Ironman_Moneymaking_Guide?action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: General tips\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Many of these strategies benefit from various things that are not strict requirements for the strategy itself.

This method does have drawbacks: it is based on luck somewhat, since the stores' stock is based on the activity of other players in the game - if many other players are buying/selling gems, you will have to hop more, and you will get less experience and gold per hour. In testing over a 5-minute period, buying 1 sapphire and 1 emerald, cutting them, then selling them each after hopping worlds and buying more, an average rate of 90k per hour and 24k Crafting exp per hour was achieved.

Ironmen have to do activities that specifically generate ''[[coins]]'' in some way, as they cannot use the [[Grand Exchange]] to simply trade the items in exchange for coins. For example, a regular account could kill [[Zulrah]], receive a [[tanzanite fang]] and then sell it to the Grand Exchange for {{Coins|{{GEP|Tanzanite fang|1}}}} and the player would have that amount in coins, but an Ironman would only get 66,000 coins from its High Alchemy value.\n\nBecause of the restrictions Ironmen are placed under, many traditional money making methods are difficult or impossible to perform. Most money making methods typically involve casting [[High Level Alchemy]] to convert items into coins. Players should alch the items while doing other activities which can be done on the normal spellbook, do not require full inventory and have some downtime to cast the spell. Such activities include farm runs, bird house runs, questing, training Agility, training Hunter and melee combat.\n\nAt very low levels, players can also sell various alchable items to shops, but once the player can use High Level Alchemy and has the money to buy the nature runes, it is better to alch the items as it generates more profit and it can be done in \"zero time\". Setting level 55 Magic as a short-term goal is therefore recommended for low-level Ironmen.\n\nWith 50 [[Agility]] and [[Thieving]], players can sell items to [[Martin Thwait]] in the [[Rogues' Den|Rogue's Den]] for their high alchemy price. The [[Bandit Duty Free|Wilderness Bandit Camp General Store]] buys at the same price and has no requirements, but beware of [[Player Killers]]. After completing [[Plague City]], players can access the [[West Ardougne General Store]] which buys items for just below their high alchemy price. These stores are useful for players without 55 magic or for selling junk items that aren't worth alching. Specialty stores generally buy items for around their high alchemy price, and often have no requirements.\n\n==General tips==\nMany of these strategies benefit from various things that are not strict requirements for the strategy itself. This is an incomplete list of these things.\n\nThere are also more general purpose guides at [[Ironman guide]] and [[Ultimate Ironman Guide]].\n\nThe [[graceful outfit]] provides a run energy regeneration effect that allows players to run around for longer periods. This is particularly useful for Ironmen who have more limited access to teleportation methods. It is highly recommended to get this outfit early on in a playthrough. Ultimate Ironmen are recommended to also get a [[magic wardrobe]] to store the outfit.\n\nCommon items that can be converted into coins:\n*Adamant, rune and dragon items\n*High-level runes; these can be sold to Ali Morrisane\n*Dragonhide bodies and battlestaves, and their raw materials\n*Rune and dragon javelin heads\n*Ores and bars (mainly adamantite and runite); the ores can be processed into bars in the Blast Furnace, and the bars then smithed into platebodies\n*High-level gems (mainly rubies, diamonds and dragonstones); these can be made into valuable jewellery\n*[[Onyx bolt tips]]; these can be attached to runite bolts to make [[onyx bolt]]s, which can be alched for profit\n\nTraining certain skills, such as Construction, Fletching and Smithing costs a lot of money. Receiving useful supplies for those skills saves money, and that can be considered as making money effectively. Such items include:\n*[[Planks]]\n*Certain fletching materials such as [[dart tip]]s, [[bolt tip]]s, and [[arrowtips]]\n*[[Gold ore]]\n*Runes, especially blood runes\n\n===Ultimate Ironman tips===\n{{Main|Ultimate_Ironman_Guide/Item_Management}}\n\nUltimate Ironmen are quite restricted in item management due to the lack of a bank and access to noting items. The Ultimate Ironman guide contains a lot of useful information for this purpose.\n\n==Money making==\n\nKeep in mind that high alching most items provides more gold than selling the items to a shop would, so a good short term goal to aim for as a new account is 55 Magic for high alchemy. General money-making methods involve typical skilling, Slayer, Managing Miscellania, and selling various items to shops.\n{|class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+Low requirements\n!Method\n![[File:Ultimate ironman chat badge.png]]\n!Requirements\n!Category\n!Description\n|-\n|Collecting [[bronze chainbodies]]\n|Yes\n|None\n|Collecting\n|A bronze chainbody spawns to the north of [[Boot]].

The steel platebodies can then be sold to [[general store]]s for 800gp, to [[Horvik]]'s [[Horvik's Armour Shop|shop]] in Varrock for 1,200gp, or [[High alchemy|high alched]] for 1,200gp.\n\nThis method is not recommended for Hardcore Ironmen, since players are at risk of being killed by player killers in the Wilderness.\n[[File:Ultimate ironman chat badge.png]] This is generally not viable for Ultimate Ironmen except in the start of a playthrough when you have few items to risk.\n|-\n|Cutting gems at a [[gem shop]]\n|Yes\n|20 [[Crafting]], 27 recommended to cut [[Emeralds]]\n|Skilling/shops\n|Players may buy uncut gems from a Gem Shop, cut the gems, and then sell the cut gems back to the shop for a fair amount of profit. This moneymaker does not require going into the Wilderness, it has low requirements, it is a medium level of click-intensiveness, and players may travel to other gem shops if the one they have been using seems to have a low stock of gems in most worlds. This method does have drawbacks: it is based on luck somewhat, since the stores' stock is based on the activity of other players in the game - if many other players are buying/selling gems, you will have to hop more, and you will get less experience and gold per hour. In testing over a 5-minute period, buying 1 sapphire and 1 emerald, cutting them, then selling them each after hopping worlds and buying more, an average rate of 90k per hour and 24k Crafting exp per hour was achieved. However, the shops' stock did not seem to replenish emeralds fast enough, to sustain the method over an hour period.\n|-\n|[[Fletching]] [[willow shortbow]]s\n|Yes\n|{{SCP|Fletching|35+}}, {{SCP|Woodcutting|30+}}, {{SCP|Crafting|10}}\n|Skilling\n|[[Fletching]] and [[Woodcutting]] level fairly fast, are very low intensity, are quite useful, and are required several times through [[quests]]. A way to produce some decent money is by [[fletching]] the highest available bow fully completing them. Afterwards, any bows created can be [[High alchemy|high alched]] or sold to [[general store]]s.\n|-\n|Stealing from [[H.A.M. storeroom]]s\n|Yes with alch\n|{{SCP|Thieving|20}}, food, completed at least half of [[Death to the Dorgeshuun]]\n|Skilling\n|After completing half of [[Death to the Dorgeshuun]], players have access to the [[H.A.M. storeroom]]s. There, one is able to [[pickpocket]] guards that commonly give keys to chests which provide [[H.A.M. Store room#Rewards|fairly good jewellery]]. Bank or high alch the loot obtained and make sure to save some of the [[emerald ring]]s and [[sapphire necklace]]s for personal use. This is considered the best low level method for ironmen and is highly recommended.\n(wearing full [[H.A.M. robes]] helps reduce the chance of being kicked out when in the [[H.A.M. Hideout]], but players will never be kicked out in the storeroom area so [[Rogue equipment|Rogue's equipment]] is recommended to potentially double the rate of keys).\n|-\n|Stealing [[silk]]\n|No\n|{{SCP|Thieving|20}}\n|Skilling\n|[[Silk]] can be stolen from the [[Silk stall|stalls]] in the [[Ardougne]] [[Ardougne market|market]]. After waiting 20 minutes the stolen silk can be sold to the [[Silk merchant]] (located in the market) for 60 coins each.\n|-\n|Selling [[cats]] for [[death runes]]\n|Yes\n|[[Gertrude's Cat]] quest, [[Ardougne Diary#Easy|easy Ardougne diary]], 9 fish.\n|Collecting\n|Cats can be traded in for 200 death runes each in West Ardougne (100 death runes before completition of the easy tasks of Ardougne Diary). Raising a [[kitten]] to adulthood requires three hours and 9 fish. Every 20 minutes, interact with the kitten, stroke it twice, and use a fish on it. Once it is fully grown, you can trade it to a [[civilian]] in West Ardougne for 200 death runes. Assuming you would buy the runes for 200 coins each, this saves you 40,000 coins, or about 13,300 coins an hour.\n\nThis method is especially useful while using AFK training methods such as [[fletching]] or [[sand crab]]s, as it gives you an income boost with less than five minutes of time invested. \n|-\n|[[Agility Pyramid]]\n|Yes\n|{{SCP|Agility|30}}\n(70+ Recommended)\n|Minigame\n|The [[Agility Pyramid]] can be unlocked at 30 Agility, however, 70 is recommended as obstacle fail rates are drastically reduced. Players can make up to around 200,000 coins per hour.\n\nBecause most of the activity involves running around, you may want to bring supplies to train other skills, such as high alching noted items or fletching [[dart]]s.\n\n[[File:Ultimate ironman chat badge.png]] This method requires no banking and does not suffer greatly from not having an empty inventory. It is one of the most reliable methods for early game.\n|-\n|Selling runes from [[Guardians of the Rift]] to [[Ali Morrisane]]\n|Yes\n|{{SCP|runecraft|27}}, completion of [[Temple of the Eye]] and [[Rogue Trader]]\n|Skilling\n|Guardians of the Rift is an efficient Runecraft method which yields a large number of valuable catalytic runes. Starting at level 27 you can make runes and gain rewards from the Guardians of the Rift minigame, these can then be sold to Ali Morrisane's rune shop for GP. These runes are also useful for early game magic training and teleports. Nature, Chaos, Law and Blood runes can be gained as a reward from the minigame and sell for a good of GP. You can expect around 30k xp per hour, and around 60k gp/hr. This will increase further as you unlock the ability to craft high tier catalytic runes. \nNote that the runecraft level requirements can be gained from the [[Enter the Abyss]] and Temple of the Eye quest.\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+Medium requirements\n!Method\n![[File:Ultimate ironman chat badge.png]]\n!Requirements\n!Category\n!Description\n|-\n|Blackjacking\n|Yes\n|{{SCP|Thieving|45}}\nCompletion of [[The Feud]], Full [[rogue equipment]]\n|Skilling\n|[[Blackjacking]] is an efficient [[Thieving training]] method which also yields a decent amount of coins. It has fairly few requirements, which makes it one of the best ways to make money at lower levels. Players can make up to around 200,000 coins per hour when blackjacking [[Menaphite Thug]]s from level 65 onwards with full [[Rogue equipment]], which requires 50 [[Thieving]] and 50 [[Agility]] to obtain.\n\nMore information about blackjacking can be found [[Thieving training#Levels 45–91/99: Blackjacking|here]].  \n|-\n|Collecting and alching [[ecumenical key]]s\n|No\n|{{SCP|Agility|60}} or {{SCP|Strength|60}}, {{SCP|Magic|55}} and Nature runes,\nMonk robe and Unholy symbol and Ranged/Magic combat equipment\n|Combat\n|Enter the GWD through the Wilderness entrance north of the Bandit Camp.\nWith level 60 Agility walk south and enter the main room now run north to the Zamorak zone safe space. Do the same for level 60 Strength but entering to the north then running south towards the same spot.\n\nEither range or mage the low level imps located here until they drop Ecumenical keys, but do not alch them whilst in the wilderness, so they are kept on death. Once 2 have been obtained, leave, high alch the keys and bank the coins.\n\nA maximum of 3 keys total may be held at any time (4 and 5 with the Medium and Hard [[Wilderness Diary|Wilderness Diaries]] completed), though obtaining the maximum count in one trip is inadvisable to decrease risked wealth on death.\n|-\n|Crafting battlestaves\n|No\n|{{SCP|Crafting|54, 58, 62, or 66}} and {{SCP|Magic|56, 60, 63, or 66}}\n|Skilling\n|Craft battlestaves and high alch for profit. Efficient crafting involves either numerous and high requirements (see below, Fire battlestaves) or risking being attacked by PKers in the Wilderness. Orbs may be obtained via glassblowing or Wyverns, and battlestaves from Baba Yaga, the Wizards' Guild, and the daily barrel near Zaff after completing Varrock task sets.\n|-\n|Slayer\n|Yes\n|{{SCP|Combat|80+}}, {{SCP|Slayer|50+}}\n|Combat\n|Slayer is the sole way to upgrade a number of the best-in-slot items, and making sizeable amounts of money in the process. At a certain point it becomes something players '''must''' do if they ever want to get any key items such as the abyssal whip or dragon boots. Money-making from slayer is extremely variable as some slayer monsters, such as Kurasks and Brutal black dragons, can be extremely useful, while others such as Elves and Zygomites can be nearly worthless.\n|-\n|High alching [[rune arrow]]s from [[Last Man Standing]]\n|Yes\n|{{SCP|Magic|55}}, {{SCP|Runecraft|44}} recommended, [[staff of fire]].\n|Minigame\n|Last Man Standing is a PvP minigame with no requirements and no risk of death. [[Justine's stuff for the Last Shopper Standing|Justine's shop]] sells a stack of 300 rune arrows for 3 points, which can be high alched for 240 gold each. Teleport to the [[Ferox Enclave]] using a [[Ring of Dueling]] and join the competitive lobby. Kill one player inside the game, then hide from other players by staying in a corner of the map or going upstairs inside a building (not the wooden towers). Wait until there are three players remaining, then run towards the safe zone. The remaining two players will be too busy fighting to kill you, and once one of the final two players die, you can either run into the lethal fog or let the final player kill you. By using this strategy, you will come in second or third place and earn 4 or 3 points a game.\n\nPlayers who do not wish to gain combat experience, like [[Skillers]], may opt to purchase 350 adamant arrows per LMS point instead, and sell the arrows to [[Brian (Rimmington)|Brian]] in [[Rimmington]]. This process can be somewhat tedious, as players can only sell 50 arrows per world, in order to find a balance between speed and profit. For example, if a player had 13,000 arrows or so to sell, they would need to hop worlds around 270 times in order to sell all of them. Selling 350 addy arrows (costing 1 LMS point) to Brian (by hopping to 7 different worlds) yields 7,112gp.\n\nOnce you've purchased a stack of 300 arrows, you can immediately buy 300 [[nature runes]] at an average of 200 gold each and alch the stack for a profit of 12,000gp. As this profit is unimpressive, the better method is to runecraft the nature runes at the [[Nature Altar]], then use the free runes to alch the stack for a profit of 72,000gp. Assuming 6 Last Man Standing points and 600 nature runes an hour, this equates to 144,000gp an hour.\n\nAs the stack can be alched while performing other activities such as the [[Agility Pyramid]], this method offers a convenient way to increase your coin stack while also gaining decent magic experience.\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+High requirements\n!Method\n![[File:Ultimate ironman chat badge.png]]\n!Requirements\n!Category\n!Description\n|-\n|Pickpocketing Knights of Ardougne\n|Yes\n|{{SCP|Thieving|55}} (95+ strongly recommended)\n\nCompletion of the medium tasks of the Ardougne Diary\n\nFull rogue equipment\n|Skilling\n|Pickpocketing [[Knight of Ardougne|Knights of Ardougne]] is an easier and slightly more profitable alternative to blackjacking, but it also has higher requirements. From level 95 onwards, players can make up to around 270,000–280,000 coins per hour.\n\nMore information about pickpocketing Knights of Ardougne can be found [[Thieving training#Levels 55–99: Knights of Ardougne|here]].\n|-\n|Charging [[fire orb]]s\n|No\n|{{SCP|Agility|70+}} ({{SCP|Agility|80+}} recommended) {{SCP|Crafting|62}}, {{SCP|Magic|63}}, {{SCP|Prayer|43}} or decent defence and hitpoints, the Castle Wars balloon unlocked, and completion of Lunar Diplomacy or {{SCP|Magic|66}} for access to battlestaves on-demand over the daily supply from the Varrock tasks.\n|Skilling\n|Charging fire orbs and crafting battlestaves is a solid way to make money and train Crafting, with decent Magic experience as well. With all the requirements, this is also faster than Air orbs. Begin at Castle Wars wearing a fire staff, ring of dueling, and anti-dragon shield. Bring cosmic runes, a set of normal logs, an antidote++, and fill the rest of the inventory with unpowered orbs. If lower than 70 Agility, bring a Dusty key. Take the balloon to Taverley, running towards the Fire Obelisk (80 Agility makes this fastest, 70 Agility is also viable, lower makes this very tedious), charge the unpowered orbs, then teleport back to Castle Wars to repeat the process. With lower than 80 Agility, this is very run-intensive, so a training method that can be done at a bank (such as fletching) while waiting for run to restore may be desired. Battlestaves can be bought for 7,000 coins from Zaff's daily stock and the finished Fire battlestaves can be alched for 9,300 coins.\n|-\n|Crafting blood runes\n|Yes\n|{{SCP|Runecraft|77}} and {{SCP|Agility|73}}\n|Skilling\n|Using any pickaxe and a chisel, mine dense essence, venerate them, run to the Blood Altar, and repeat. One run returns 212 blood runes, which the player can sell to [[Ali Morrisane]] for 200 gp each. The player can make up to 330,000 gp and gain up to 38,000 experience per hour with optimised runs.\n|-\n|[[Blast Mine|Blast mining]] and smithing runite\n|Maybe\n|{{SCP|Mining|75}}, {{SCP|Smithing|89}}\n\n100% [[Lovakengj]] [[favour]]\n\n[[Dynamite]]s\n\n[[Coal]] for smelting the bars\n|Skilling\n|[[Blast Mine|Blast mining]] offers decent Mining experience and good profit. At level 75, players can obtain runite from the blasted ores, which makes the bulk of the profit gained.\n\nFor this method, players will need a lot of [[dynamite]]s. They can be obtained in large amounts from the [[Chambers of Xeric]]. Players who have completed the elite tasks in the [[Kourend & Kebos Diary]] can claim 80 dynamites from [[Thirus]] every day. Buying the dynamites is not recommended, as this slows experience rates and cuts down the profit a lot.\n\nSmelt the ores obtained from Blast mining at the [[Blast Furnace]]. Additional coal can be bought at the Blast Furnace or acquired from [[Miscellania]]. Smith all runite bars into rune items, such as [[rune sword]]s, and alch them for profit.\n|-\n|Crafting [[Amethyst javelin heads]]\n|Yes\n|{{SCP|Mining|92}}, {{SCP|Crafting|87}}\n|Skilling\n|Mining Amethyst to craft and cast high alchemy on [[Amethyst javelin heads]] is a low intensity and afk method of obtaining a constant source of gold. At high Mining levels and with efficient gear, players can expect to mine anywhere from 80 to 100 amethyst per hour, resulting in between 400-500 Amethyst javelin heads, resulting in between 364,800-456,000 gp worth of alchable materials. This method can be useful for Ultimate Ironman players as the amount of inventory space needed is minimal, needing only the ability to cast [[High alchemy]], a [[chisel]], and enough inventory to hold at least one [[amethyst]].\nFor increased efficiency, completion of the [[Varrock Elite Diary]] gives the player access to [[Varrock armour 4]], which gives an additional chance to mine an [[Amethyst]]. [[Expert mining gloves]] can be purchased within the [[Mining Guild]], and gives a 25% chance that the node will not be depleted, and the player will continue mining the rock until it depletes. The [[Celestial ring]] offers an invisible +4 boost to Mining while worn, but does not offer an additional chance at mining ore.\n\n|-\n|Killing [[Vorkath]]\n|Yes\n|High {{SCP|Combat}}, [[Dragon Slayer II]] completed\n|Combat\n|Killing Vorkath can be very lucrative in getting cash, through rune and dragon equipment drops as well as dragonhide, in addition to a lot of skilling supplies. [[Dragon hunter lance]] or a [[dragon hunter crossbow]] is highly recommended, and killing it only on a [[blue dragon]] task for the extra [[Slayer]] experience is most efficient.\n\nMore information on killing Vorkath can be found [[Vorkath/Strategies|here]].\n|-\n|Killing [[rune dragon]]s\n|Yes\n|High {{SCP|Combat}}, [[Dragon Slayer II]] completed\n|Combat\n|Killing rune dragons requires relatively low effort and can be very lucrative in getting cash, through the runite bars and valuable alchables.

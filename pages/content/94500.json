In other words, it's attempting to kill an already weakened opponent who may be busy looking at their loot from a previous kill. Pile jumping can be considered as dishonorable since the player being jumped may have been able to easily take out their jumper if they were ready.\n\nThe abbreviaton '''PJing''' can also mean '''player jumping''' or '''player jacking''', which is attacking a player whose opponent is not dead yet.\n\nThe word ''pile'' refers to multiple players attacking another.\n\n==Example of pile jumping==\nPlayer A finishes his match against Player B. Player A receives his loot and is suddenly attacked by Player C. Player C's goal is to kill Player A, receiving the loot from both Player A and Player B. Player C is a pile jumper in this scenario.\n\n==Example of player jacking==\nPlayer B is running away or eating constantly and not attacking Player A. If Player A is also eating or not attacking for a short period of time, Player C is able to player-jack either player.\n\n==How to avoid pile jumping==\nThere is no perfect way to avoid pile jumping, but these tips still help in escaping a pile jumping incident:\n\n*'''Teleporting''': You may [[teleport]] as a method of escaping, but it will not work if you have been [[teleblock]]ed, or are in higher than level 20 [[Wilderness]]. However, players can use enchanted dragonstone jewellery and Magic seed pods to teleport out below lv 30 wilderness.

Try to eat food to get your [[Hitpoints]] as high as possible before you start picking up the loot, equip any \"tanking\" [[gear]] you may have, and turn on [[Protect from Melee]] if you can. This will greatly improve your chance to survive a pile jump.\n*'''Be aware of your surroundings''': Look around, and find any one with the common PJ gear. [[Void armour|Void]], [[Ballista]], [[Dark bow]], [[Bandos armour]], [[Godsword]], [[Ahrim's]], [[Dragon claws]]/[[Dragon dagger|dagger]], [[Initiate armour]], [[Mystic robes]], etc.\n\n==Historical pile jumping==\nPile-jumping originated in a more literal sense, where a \"pile\" of [[player-killer]]s coordinating with each other would enter the medium and high level areas of the [[Wilderness]] to ambush any players unlucky enough to come within view. The group of players would stand in one game square, which is called a ''death dot'', usually with a lower level player last to enter, to appear as one player. Many victims would fall for the trick and attack the visible low level player, while others would notice the stack by right-clicking. It was rare that a victim of original PJing would survive, and even rarer that they would defeat the ambushers. A common tactic was to have at least two [[mage]]s performing [[Ancient Magicks]] who would alternate in [[Ice spells|freezing]] the target. Pile jumping in this sense was eliminated in 2007, and was generally lost as new generations of players entered the scene who had never experienced this kind of [[PvP]]. This kind of PJing obviously required teamwork and a relatively high level of trust in the group you were performing it with, and often was a way that a group of friends could [[scams|lure]] another player in for backstabbing within their group.\n\n==Effective ways to pile jump==\nEven though pile-jumping is considered \"dishonourable\", it is still a wide and successful practice. Pile-jumping is often done with a KO [[weapon]], such as a [[Rune 2h sword]], which is commonly used in [[free-to-play]] worlds. This way, if a [[PKer]] does not eat/has no food and/or use [[protection prayers]] and starts looting their kill right away, they will be in for a surprise attack. However, this will not usually deal enough damage to actually obtain the drop, simply because the PKer's kill had done more damage than the pile-jumper themself. In [[members]]', things are slightly different. With much higher hitting weapons, there is more of a danger for a nearby pile-jumper just lurking, waiting and watching for the correct chance to strike.\n\nOne very successful pile-jumping weapon is the [[Dark bow]]. The \"Descent of Dragons\" [[special attack]] already has enough power to kill a player in one hit—it is even more devastating if it is used on another PKer who has just killed and looted someone. When using this method, make sure that your target has eaten '''AND''' picked up the loot, or else you will get nothing at all. The [[Dragon dagger]] and [[Dragon claws]] are also popular weapons to pile jump with.\n\nThe [[Ancient Magic]] spell, [[Ice Blitz]], can be used to not only hold your opponent in place, but add extra damage or so. It is used over the spell, [[Ice Barrage]], due to the fact that barrage hits instantly, whereas blitz takes a while to hit, and by that time, you could be just about to attack, meaning you can stack the hits, leaving no time for eating. This is often used with an [[Armadyl godsword]] special.{{fact}}\n\n==PJing in RuneScape Classic==\nIn ''[[RuneScape Classic]]'', the term pile jumper has an alternate meaning.

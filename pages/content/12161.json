The Mahjarrat have powerful innate magical powers, some of them delving into necromancy or manipulating the [[Shadow Realm]], and all of them capable of shapeshifting and sensing the presence of another member of their race.\n\nAlthough not immortal, Mahjarrat age slowly and take the appearance of skeletal humanoids. They are primarily followers of the [[gods]] [[Zamorak]] or [[Zaros]] and often reference \"going North\". Additionally, General Khazard and his men make reference to a 'ritual' amongst the Mahjarrat performed 'in the place of half light and ice' when the planets are aligned, which may be related.\n\n==History==\nThe Mahjarrat were created by the Elder God [[Mah]], after whom their race is named. When [[Zaros]], one of Mah's original two creations, left her, Mah began unintentionally to dream the Mahjarrat into existence. They were pale imitations of Zaros and his counterpart [[Seren]].{{CiteNPC|npc=Memory of Seren|quote=In her desperation for him to return, she has created new life in his image. They are pale imitations though, shadows of him and I.}} Seren was concerned, as the creation of the Mahjarrat made Mah grow weaker. Seren appeared before the Mahjarrat and instructed them to regularly sacrifice one of their members to restore Mah. Despite the sacrificing rituals, Mah grew weaker and began to dream more monstrous and instinctual beings into existence.{{CiteNPC|npc=Memory of Seren|quote= All may not be lost though, for I may be able to convince them to sacrifice their energy and return it to her. [...]  The beings that sacrificed themselves for her slowed things down, but it hasn't been enough.}}\n\nThe Mahjarrat at some point around the [[Second Age]] arrived on [[Gielinor]], initially they were in the service of [[Icthlarin]], but their allegiance to him was eventually lost and they joined [[Zaros]] and the [[Zarosian Empire]].{{CiteNPC|npc=Sphinx|quote=He once even was worshipped by the Mahjarrat but they turned away from him in the Third Age to follow Zamorak. Or maybe it was Zaros to whom they turned; it was a long time ago and not that important.}} The Mahjarrat felt that Zaros truly understood their nature and his greater power would bring them more glory, according to [[Azzanadra]].{{CitePostbag|issue=9|letter=Letter 5|author=Azzanadra}}\n\n[[File:Old Shrine south-east of Weiss.png|right|thumb|An [[Old Shrine|old shrine]] found in [[Weiss|the North]], which is of importance to the Mahjarrat.]]\nAfter centuries in the service of Zaros, unrest and dissatisfaction began to grow among some of Mahjarrat, particularly the general [[Zamorak]], who began to plan a rebellion with some of his fellow Mahjarrat. When Zamorak got his hands on the [[Staff of Armadyl]], he and his allies (including [[Hazeel]] and [[Zemouregal]]) began the rebellion, which resulted in Zamorak ascending to godhood, Zaros' banishment and the beginning of the end of the Zarosian Empire.\n\nMany of the Mahjarrat took part in the following [[God Wars]] either fighting for Zamorak or remaining loyal to Zaros. [[Azzanadra]] is a particularly important loyalist of the latter, who was locked inside the [[Jaldraocht Pyramid]] by a Zamorakian and Saradominist alliance.\n\nLittle is known of how many Mahjarrat were left by the time of the God Wars, but as of the [[Fifth Age]] only a handful of known Mahjarrat remain, many of them in hiding or imprisonment, with most knowledge about them faded into obscurity.\n\n==Known Mahjarrat==\n===Akthanakos===\n[[File:Akthanakos (skeletal).png|left|80px]]\n'''[[Akthanakos]]''' is a Zarosian Mahjarrat. He was imprisoned and trapped in the form of a [[boneguard]] for millennia by his rival [[Enakhra]]. He was eventually rescued by [[player character|an adventurer]] in year 169 of the [[Fifth Age]]. He is particularly known for sometimes appearing with a [[camel]]'s head similar to the members of the [[Menaphite Pantheon]], who were also depicted as humans with animal heads. The [[Ugthanki]] camels of the [[Kharidian Desert]] are named after him.\n\n{{clear|left}}\n===Azzanadra===\n[[File:Azzanadra.png|left|80px]]\n'''[[Azzanadra]]''' is a very powerful and devout Zarosian Mahjarrat who remained loyal to Zaros after his assasination. Azzanadra took part in the [[God Wars]] to protect the loyal and punish the traitors and enemies of Zaros. Being considered an unstoppable force, it took a combined effort of Zamorakians and [[Saradomin]]ists to overpower him, and lock him up in the [[Jaldraocht Pyramid]], where he remained until year 169 of the [[Fifth Age]], where he was released by [[player character|an adventurer]].\n\n{{clear|left}}\n===Enakhra===\n[[File:Enakhra (skeletal).png|left|70px]]\n'''[[Enakhra]]''' is a Zamorakian and the only known surviving female Mahjarrat. Enakhra had feelings for Zamorak and built a [[Enakhra's Temple|temple]] in his honour in the distant Kharidian Desert. When she showed it to Zamorak, he was uninterested and more interested in a weapon, that could kill a [[god]]. Saddened by Zamorak's rejection, Enakhra remained in the temple and did not come out. At some point, she managed to lure her rival [[Akthanakos]] to her temple, where she trapped him as a [[boneguard]]. Many years later a crusade of knights from Avarrocka came to kill her, but she easily overpowered them and trapped the only [[Pentyn|survivor]] in the temple. Years later a [[Lazim|Zamorakian mage]] and [[player character|an adventurer]] uncovered the temple that had disappeared into the sand. Enakhra's hold over Akthanakos was broken, and they both left the temple for [[the North]].\n\n{{clear|left}}\n===Hazeel===\n[[File:Hazeel.png|left|70px]]\n'''[[Hazeel]]''' is a Zamorakian Mahjarrat warlord. Hazeel was one of Zamorak's closest allies and participated in the betrayal of Zaros and the following [[God Wars]]. In the [[Fourth Age]], Hazeel established a Zamorakian state in what is today central [[Kandarin]], with Hazeel ruling the place that would eventually become [[Ardougne]]. In the early years of the [[Fifth Age]] a [[Saradomin]]ist resistance led by the ancestor of the [[Carnillean family]] managed to sneak into Hazeel's mansion and kill him. However, being a Mahjarrat, Hazeel proved  difficult to kill and he entered a state of torpor, from which he was unable to wake up. Hazeel's body was hidden by the [[Cult of Hazeel]] in the sewers outside the city, where they tried to awaken him. In the year 169 of the Fifth Age [[player character|an adventurer]] either foiled the attempt to resurrect Hazeel, or helped in restoring him.\n\n{{clear|left}}\n\n===Khazard===\n[[File:General Khazard.png|left|80px]]\n'''General [[Khazard]]''' is a Zamorakian Mahjarrat judging by his preparations for the 'ritual' with other Mahjarrat, although his followers think him an undead human maniac. He is currently involved in a conflict with the [[gnome]]s of the [[Tree Gnome Village]]. He's also running the [[Fight Arena (location)|Fight Arena]] in the centre of his camp, where kidnap victims and slaves are pitted against dangerous monsters. After capturing the nobleman [[Justin Servil]] and his son [[Sammy Servil|Sammy]], [[player character|an adventurer]] [[Fight Arena|faced Khazard's monsters and Khazard himself]] in order to free them. Khazard would later try to get revenge on the adventurer by [[The General's Shadow|luring them into a trap]], but this plan also failed. He wields some power in the [[Shadow Realm]].\n\n{{clear|left}}\n\n===Lucien===\n[[File:Lucien.png|left|80px]]\n'''[[Lucien]]''' is a Zamorakian Mahjarrat and necromancer. Lucien was responsible for an infamous attack on [[Varrock]] in Year 154 of the [[Fifth Age]], where he attempted to invade the city with an army of undead. The city was prepared with a sufficient amount of [[rune]]s and the invasion was surprisingly quickly ended. After his failure, Lucien decided to seek out the powerful artefact the [[Staff of Armadyl]] to increase his power, he asked [[player character|an adventurer]] to infiltrate the [[Temple of Ikov]] to retrieve the staff. The adventurer either brought the staff back to Lucien or allied with the [[Guardian of Armadyl|Guardians of Armadyl]] and struck Lucien down. He has hired the treasure hunter [[Movario]] in order to find artefacts of power for him.\n\n{{clear|left}}\n===Sliske===\n'''[[Sliske]]''' is a devious Zarosian Mahjarrat described as the 'serpent-tongued' and delving in the shadows. Sliske was responsible for giving the [[Barrows brothers]] their powers and [[Barrows equipment|equipment]], he followed the [[Saradomin]]ist brothers on their crusade into [[Morytania]] to liberate the land from [[Lord Drakan]]. They were formidable warriors and pushed through Drakan's lands until they reached the walls of [[Meiyerditch]], where Sliske removed their powers and thus the brothers were slaughtered and the crusade failed. Sliske raised the brothers from their [[Barrows|burial tombs]] as undead wights, claiming them as servants of Zaros. He also tricked [[Ashuelot Reis]] into releasing [[Nex]] from the [[Ancient Prison]].\n\n===Zamorak===\n'''[[Zamorak]]''' is the [[god]] of chaos and ascended from Mahjarrat to divinity by stabbing his master [[Zaros]] with the [[Staff of armadyl|Staff of Armadyl]]. Zamorak was a great general in the Zarosian Army and skilled in melee combat, but not so much magic. Having been in Zaros' service for many years, Zamorak began to grow dissatisfied and began to plot a rebellion with other Mahjarrat and high-ranking members of Zarosian society. When Zamorak was brought the mythical [[Staff of Armadyl]], he and his accomplices launched their attack, which led to Zaros' fall and eventually the [[God Wars]], a long series of conflicts lasting about four thousand years. Zamorak was eventually banished from [[Gielinor]] by [[Guthix]], who awoke and established the [[Edicts of Guthix]] to keep all gods of noteworthy power away.\n\n===Zemouregal===\n[[File:Lores and Histories - The Legend of Arrav (2).png|left|125px]]\n'''[[Zemouregal]]''' is a Zamorakian Mahjarrat, a necromancer and the infamous enemy of Avarrocka (current day [[Varrock]]). He was one of the Mahjarrat who decided to rebel along with Zamorak. Zemouregal is particularly skilled in necromancy and attempted to lay siege on Varrock with an army of undead in the [[Fourth Age]], but was fought off by the legendary hero [[Arrav]] and his [[Shield of Arrav|magic shield]]. Although his invasion failed Zemoregal succeeded in killing Arrav and resurrected him as an undead slave, intending to use him in a future scheme.\n{{clear|left}}\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Mahjarrat}}\n[[Category:Races]]"}

Aggressive monsters may attack players without being attacked first; some are aggressive based on players' [[combat level]]s, and others are aggressive regardless of level such as various [[bosses]] and most monsters in the [[Wilderness]]. Aggressive monsters can be particularly dangerous in a [[multi-combat area]] with multiple monsters. [[Non-aggressive]], or ''passive'', monsters will not attack players unless they are attacked first.\n\nSome monsters, such as [[chompies]] and [[jubblies]], will not attack a player even if engaged in [[combat]]. Yet, others, most notably [[dark beast]]s and bosses, remain hostile no matter how long the player remains in the vicinity.\n\nWhen aggressiveness is based on combat level, an aggressive monster will attack a player whose combat level is less than or equal to twice the monster's level. If the player's combat level is more than twice the monster's level, it won't attack (i.e. double the monster's combat level plus one). Since the maximum combat level for players is 126, this means monsters level 63 or greater will always be aggressive.\n\nFor example, a level 51 player enters an area with a level 28 [[hobgoblin]]. Since the player's level is less than twice the monster's level (28 × 2 = 56, which is more than 51), the hobgoblin will attack the player. Conversely, if a level 57 player enters an area with a level 28 hobgoblin, the monster will not attack because the player's level is more than twice the monster's. In this case, the hobgoblin will ignore the player (unless, of course, the player decides to attack the monster). Thus, the player would need to be level 57 or higher to avoid being attacked by the hobgoblin.\n\nDifferent monsters seem to have different levels of aggression; some, such as [[jungle horror]]s, will seek you out from many spaces away, whereas others, such as [[mountain troll]]s, are aggressive on a smaller range.\n\n==Notes==\n*After a player spends a certain amount of time (10 minutes) in the vicinity of aggressive monsters, the monsters will become [[tolerant]] of the player and become passive. However, if the player leaves the area and then returns, the monsters there become aggressive again. Note that logging out is not classed as leaving the area, so if a player logs out and logs back in again, the monsters will still be tolerant.\n*Most monsters in the [[Wilderness]] are aggressive regardless of level. Nearly all monsters on [[Ape Atoll]] exhibit this quality as well to players not holding a [[Greegree]], but they will also cease being aggressive once the [[Monkey Madness II]] [[quest]] has been completed. In addition, [[guard]]s will attack players whom they catch [[thieving]] from stalls anywhere on ''[[RuneScape]]'' regardless of the player's combat level.\n*Most [[Slayer creature]]s are passive, despite the player's combat level. This does not apply to all, however, as [[kurask]]s, [[gargoyle]]s, [[dark beast]]s, [[skeletal wyvern]]s and [[aberrant spectre]]s are aggressive.\n*[[Bandit (Bandit Camp)|Desert bandit]]s south of [[Bedabin Camp]] will always be aggressive to players wearing [[god]] items.\n*Desert bandits (to players not wearing [[Saradomin]] or [[Zamorak]] items) and [[Al Kharid Warriors]] are both passive until a player attacks one. All of the other warriors or bandits in the vicinity will then attack that player because both areas are [[multi-combat]].\n*Creatures that never become tolerant provide excellent AFK training opportunities, such as [[Dark beast|dark beasts]] (90 [[Slayer]] required), [[Bandit (Bandit Camp)|desert bandits]] and all monsters within the [[Nightmare Zone]] [[minigame]].\n[[Category:Mechanics]]\n[[Category:Combat]]\n{{Combat Mechanics}}"}

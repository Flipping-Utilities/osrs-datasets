Only one item has the same ID, unlike how multiple items can have the same name. The ID of an item can be used to lookup <a href=\"/w/Grand_Exchange_price\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Grand Exchange price\">Grand Exchange prices</a> and get additional information about an item from the database, such as the examine text and value. Seemingly identical items may have different IDs as they are used for different purposes.\n<ul><li><a href=\"/w/Unobtainable_items\" title=\"Unobtainable items\">Unobtainable items</a>, such as <a href=\"/w/Hazelmere%27s_book\" title=\"Hazelmere&#39;s book\">Hazelmere's book</a>, exist within the game's code, have an ID number assigned to it, but are never seen via normal gameplay. Instead, they are found within the game's cache.</li>\n<li>Item IDs can be shown on this wiki by navigating to the <a href=\"/w/Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-gadgets\" title=\"Special:Preferences\">user preferences</a> page and enabling the \"advanced data\" gadget. The ID will then be shown on item articles at the bottom of the infobox.</li></ul></li>\n<li><b>Graphics</b>: All obtainable items have graphics. There are four main types of graphics items may have:\n<ul><li>All items may be held in the <a href=\"/w/Inventory\" title=\"Inventory\">inventory</a> and therefore have inventory pictures, restricted to a size of 36 x 32 pixels. The inventory icon also appears in the <a href=\"/w/Grand_Exchange\" title=\"Grand Exchange\">Grand Exchange</a> box and the <a href=\"/w/Equipment_Stats\" title=\"Equipment Stats\">equipment screen</a>, albeit its outline and shadow may vary.<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a href=\"/w/File:Inventory_icon_generator.gif\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/Inventory_icon_generator.gif/250px-Inventory_icon_generator.gif?7a91e\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"250\" height=\"238\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/Inventory_icon_generator.gif/375px-Inventory_icon_generator.gif?7a91e 1.5x, /images/thumb/Inventory_icon_generator.gif/500px-Inventory_icon_generator.gif?7a91e 2x\" data-file-width=\"640\" data-file-height=\"609\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/w/File:Inventory_icon_generator.gif\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Mod West showcases the program used to generate inventory icons.</div></div></div></li>\n<li>The inventory icon is not created individually from other models. Rather, it is generated by taking the model used when the item is dropped on the floor (as such, destroy-only items have models when dropped on the floor as well) and displaying it. Artists set the angle/rotation/translation that the model should be displayed at in the item's config file, and lets the game engine take care of the rest. However, the artists have no control over how the game engine decides what to render and what to ignore on a pixel level when dealing with small details within a model.</li>\n<li>The third kind of item graphic is equipment that is equipped on the player, which is a 3D model that is usually more detailed than the inventory/dropped appearance.</li>\n<li>A fourth appearance for items is an appearance in a <a href=\"/w/Chatbox\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chatbox\">chatbox</a>, such as when an <a href=\"/w/NPC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"NPC\">NPC</a> gives you an item, and it appears as a larger version of the inventory icon (with textures).</li>\n<li>In addition, some items may have graphics for other situations, such as animations, <a href=\"/w/POH\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"POH\">POH</a> mountings, or the player's head when talking to an NPC. All of these graphics will usually look similar to each other, normally only varying in detail.</li></ul></li>\n<li><b>Name</b>: Most items have a unique name for that particular item. Some may have the same exact name, yet have different purposes.\n<ul><li>Items in-game use <i>ucfirst</i> capitalisation, wherein the first letter of a string is capitalised, but the rest is not. For example, as an inventory item, <i><a href=\"/w/TzTok-Jad\" title=\"TzTok-Jad\">TzTok-Jad</a>'s</i> pet is called <i><a href=\"/w/Tzrek-jad\" title=\"Tzrek-jad\">Tzrek-jad</a></i>, but as a follower it's called <i>TzRek-Jad</i>.</li>\n<li>While items in-game can share the same name, such as \"Key\", every item has a distinct config name within the game's code. For example, the item \"<a href=\"/w/Key_(Witch%27s_House)\" title=\"Key (Witch&#39;s House)\">Key</a>\" used during the <a href=\"/w/Witch%27s_House\" title=\"Witch&#39;s House\">Witch's House</a> <a href=\"/w/Quest\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Quest\">quest</a> has the config name \"<code>witches_shedkey</code>\", while the item \"<a href=\"/w/Key_(The_Lost_Tribe)\" title=\"Key (The Lost Tribe)\">Key</a> used during the <a href=\"/w/The_Lost_Tribe\" title=\"The Lost Tribe\">The Lost Tribe</a> <a href=\"/w/Quest\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Quest\">quest</a> has the config name \"<code>lost_tribe_chest_key</code>\". These config names are used by <a href=\"/w/Jagex_Moderator\" title=\"Jagex Moderator\">Jagex Moderators</a> to more easily identify items when creating or fixing content.</li></ul></li>\n<li><b><a href=\"#Tradeability\">Tradeability</a></b>: Many items may be <a href=\"/w/Traded\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Traded\">traded</a> between players; however, many <a href=\"/w/Quest\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Quest\">quest</a>-related, <a href=\"/w/Holiday\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Holiday\">holiday</a>, and miscellaneous items cannot be traded (and cannot be transferred in any other way such as the <a href=\"/w/Party_Room\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Party Room\">Party Room</a>) and therefore are often called <a href=\"/w/Untradeable\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Untradeable\">untradeable</a> items or non-tradeables. Almost all tradeable items may be traded on the <a href=\"/w/Grand_Exchange\" title=\"Grand Exchange\">Grand Exchange</a> and therefore are associated with a certain price range of numbers of <a href=\"/w/Coins\" title=\"Coins\">coins</a>, which can change when the Grand Exchange updates its prices. The only tradeable items that cannot be traded on the Grand Exchange are a very small number of useless items such as burnt fish. Naturally, coins are an item that cannot be bought on the Grand Exchange either as they are the main <a href=\"/w/Currency\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Currency\">currency</a> in <i>Old School RuneScape</i>.</li>\n<li><b><a href=\"/w/Weight\" title=\"Weight\">Weight</a></b>: All unstackable items have weight which affects the player's ability to <a href=\"/w/Run\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Run\">run</a>. The higher a player's weight, the faster they lose energy while running.</li>\n<li><b><a href=\"/w/Stackable_items\" title=\"Stackable items\">Item stacking</a> (Stackability)</b>: Some items such as <a href=\"/w/Runes\" title=\"Runes\">runes</a> or <a href=\"/w/Coins\" title=\"Coins\">coins</a> will pile up in a single spot in the inventory. Other items such as <a href=\"/w/Bucket\" title=\"Bucket\">buckets</a> will take one spot per item and therefore are non-stackable. All items that are \"stackable\" have zero weight. Most non-stackable items may be converted to a stackable form using a <a href=\"/w/Bank_note\" title=\"Bank note\">bank note</a>, but bank noted items lose most of their properties as they just become a piece of paper. Bank noted items may be deposited in the bank and then withdrawn back as usable, unnoted, non-stackable items.</li>\n<li><b>Equippability</b>: Some items, such as <a href=\"/w/Weapons\" title=\"Weapons\">weapons</a> or <a href=\"/w/Armour\" title=\"Armour\">armour</a>, can be worn, giving <a href=\"/w/Bonuses\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bonuses\">bonuses</a> or penalties to different <a href=\"/w/Combat_styles\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Combat styles\">combat styles</a>. Many equipped items also have other effects.</li>\n<li><b>Coin value:</b> Items that can be sold to a shop or that can have the <a href=\"/w/Spells\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Spells\">spells</a> <a href=\"/w/High_Alchemy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"High Alchemy\">High Alchemy</a> or <a href=\"/w/Low_Level_Alchemy\" title=\"Low Level Alchemy\">Low Level Alchemy</a> cast on them have a value determining the number of coins players will get if they do one of these actions. Even if an item is untradeable, it sometimes may still be converted into coins via alchemy spells. An example of an item falling under this category is a partially <a href=\"/w/Degraded\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Degraded\">degraded</a> piece of <a href=\"/w/Barrows_equipment\" title=\"Barrows equipment\">Barrows equipment</a> or the <a href=\"/w/Ecumenical_key\" title=\"Ecumenical key\">ecumenical key</a>.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tradeability\">Tradeability</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/Items?section=2&amp;veaction=edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: Tradeability\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/w/Items?action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Tradeability\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Not every item in <i>Old School RuneScape</i> is <a href=\"/w/Tradeable\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tradeable\">tradeable</a>, and of the items that are, not every tradeable item is tradeable on the <a href=\"/w/Grand_Exchange\" title=\"Grand Exchange\">Grand Exchange</a>. When <i>RuneScape</i> was first released, all items could be traded. However, many <a href=\"/w/Quest\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Quest\">quest</a> items were made non-tradeable following complaints in 2002 that this made quests too easy. Untradeable items are not limited to those used in quests; other items, such as <a href=\"/w/Clue_scrolls\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Clue scrolls\">clue scrolls</a> are also untradeable.\n</p><p>In general, most tradeable items are tradeable on the Grand Exchange, however. The most common exception to this rule is <a href=\"/w/Coins\" title=\"Coins\">coins</a>. In general, almost every tradeable item has a \"drop\" option rather than a destroy option and will display itself on the ground. Exceptions exist (such as <a href=\"/w/Impling\" title=\"Impling\">implings</a> in jars).\n</p><p>Trivially, any tradeable item may be offered to another player via the trade screen, and this may be the only way to get items not available on the Grand Exchange.\n</p><p>As a basic rule, tradeable items share properties and they may be:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Traded to other players for coins or other items.</li>\n<li>They will appear to other players on <a href=\"/w/Death\" title=\"Death\">death</a> or after the item is dropped onto the ground (some <a href=\"/w/Untradeable\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Untradeable\">untradeable</a> items are converted into coins or other items if the player dies in the <a href=\"/w/Wilderness\" title=\"Wilderness\">Wilderness</a>).</li>\n<li>Sold to a <a href=\"/w/General_store\" title=\"General store\">general store</a> or <a href=\"/w/Speciality_shop\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Speciality shop\">speciality shop</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/w/High_Level_Alchemy\" title=\"High Level Alchemy\">High</a> or <a href=\"/w/Low_Level_Alchemy\" title=\"Low Level Alchemy\">Low-alched</a> into coins.</li>\n<li>Converted into <a href=\"/w/Bank_note\" title=\"Bank note\">notes</a>.</li></ul>\n<p>The latter three rules, however, are not limited to tradeable items. Untradeable items may or may not be alchemiseable. Similarly, some tradeable items cannot be alchemised, such as <a href=\"/w/Membership_bond\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Membership bond\">membership bonds</a>.\n</p><p>Even if an item is tradeable, <a href=\"/w/Free_players\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Free players\">free players</a> will not be able to trade it away to players nor a shop if it is a <a href=\"/w/Members\" title=\"Members\">members</a>-only item.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Dropping_and_destroying\">Dropping and destroying</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/Items?section=3&amp;veaction=edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: Dropping and destroying\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/w/Items?action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Dropping and destroying\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Many items may be <b>dropped</b> on the ground. There is a limit to the number of items that can be dropped on the ground. Once 129 of the same item are dropped on the ground within the same game chunk, successive items of that same type dropped will not exceed the 129 limit within the squares of that game chunk. But instead, once additional of that same item are dropped, they begin to replace those already on the ground instead. Meaning, those on the ground are removed and replaced by those dropped instantly. This raises the possibility for one players items that are currently on the ground to be de-spawned by another player who might quickly drop enough items to reach the 129 item limit for that chunk. Items dropped on the ground disappear after a certain time. <a href=\"/w/Tradeable\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tradeable\">Tradeable</a> items and items dropped by monsters appear to other <a href=\"/w/Player\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Player\">players</a> 60 seconds after being dropped, and disappear after 120 seconds if not picked up. <a href=\"/w/Untradeable\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Untradeable\">Untradeable</a> items simply disappear 180 seconds after being dropped. Items placed on a table will disappear after 600 seconds if not picked up. Items dropped on <a href=\"/w/Tutorial_Island\" title=\"Tutorial Island\">Tutorial Island</a> will disappear after 30 seconds.\n</p><p>If <a href=\"/w/Ranged\" title=\"Ranged\">Ranged</a> projectiles are dropped on the ground as a result of their usage, they appear to other players one at a time, and correspondingly disappear one at a time.\n</p><p>Some items may not be dropped on the ground; they have no \"<a href=\"/w/Drop\" title=\"Drop\">Drop</a>\" option in their right-click menu. Instead, they have a \"<a href=\"/w/Destroy_(Action)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Destroy (Action)\">Destroy</a>\" option, which allows the player to remove the item from their possession.\n</p><p>The <b>destroy</b> option was introduced with the <a href=\"/w/Garden_of_Tranquillity\" title=\"Garden of Tranquillity\">Garden of Tranquillity</a> quest. This is a feature in <i>Old School RuneScape</i> for certain <a href=\"/w/Quest\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Quest\">quest</a>-related items, <a href=\"/w/Discontinued_items\" title=\"Discontinued items\">discontinued items</a>, <a href=\"/w/Achievement_Diary\" title=\"Achievement Diary\">Achievement Diary</a> item rewards and <a href=\"/w/Holiday\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Holiday\">holiday</a> drops that replaces the usual \"Drop\" option available to all other items. It most often applies to items which cannot be traded. There is usually a warning screen that appears when \"destroy\" option is selected that asks if the player is sure they want to destroy the item, and also explains how to get the item again (or that it cannot be re-obtained). <a href=\"/w/Members\" title=\"Members\">Members</a>-only items will always have a \"Drop\" option on <a href=\"/w/Free\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Free\">free</a> worlds; however, trying to drop the item will still trigger the dialogue box for destroying the item.\n</p><p>Most modern holiday items, such as the <a href=\"/w/Chicken_outfit\" title=\"Chicken outfit\">chicken outfit</a>, can be destroyed and retrieved from <a href=\"/w/Diango\" title=\"Diango\">Diango</a> in <a href=\"/w/Draynor_Village\" title=\"Draynor Village\">Draynor Village</a>.\n</p><p>Sometimes, if a player wishes to drop a high-value item, a warning screen will appear. The item is not protected by anything, so other players will still see it after 60 seconds, and it will still disappear after an additional 60 seconds. Be careful of what you wish to drop.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Discontinuation\">Discontinuation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/Items?section=4&amp;veaction=edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: Discontinuation\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/w/Items?action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Discontinuation\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Unlike in its parent game <a href=\"https://runescape.wiki/w/RuneScape\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"rsw:RuneScape\">RuneScape</a>, the team of <a href=\"/w/Old_School_RuneScape\" title=\"Old School RuneScape\">Old School RuneScape</a> have taken special care to prevent discontinued items. All <a href=\"/w/Holiday_items\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Holiday items\">holiday items</a> are able to be reobtained every year at their respective holiday dates.

Players distinguish them by their names and graphics. The game additionally seems to distinguish items by ID numbers that are not visible to players in-game.\n\n==Characteristics==\nItems can be described by a number of characteristics:\n*'''ID''': All of the items in ''Old School RuneScape'' have a unique number that identifies it, invisible to players in-game. Only one item has the same ID, unlike how multiple items can have the same name. The ID of an item can be used to lookup [[Grand Exchange price]]s and get additional information about an item from the database, such as the examine text and value. Seemingly identical items may have different IDs as they are used for different purposes.\n**[[Unobtainable items]], such as [[Hazelmere's book]], exist within the game's code, have an ID number assigned to it, but are never seen via normal gameplay. Instead, they are found within the game's cache.\n**Item IDs can be shown on this wiki by navigating to the [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-gadgets|user preferences]] page and enabling the \"advanced data\" gadget. The ID will then be shown on item articles at the bottom of the infobox.\n*'''Graphics''': All obtainable items have graphics. There are four main types of graphics items may have:\n**All items may be held in the [[inventory]] and therefore have inventory pictures, restricted to a size of 36 x 32 pixels. The inventory icon also appears in the [[Grand Exchange]] box and the [[Equipment Stats|equipment screen]], albeit its outline and shadow may vary.[[File:Inventory icon generator.gif|thumb|250px|Mod West showcases the program used to generate inventory icons.]]\n**The inventory icon is not created individually from other models. Rather, it is generated by taking the model used when the item is dropped on the floor (as such, destroy-only items have models when dropped on the floor as well) and displaying it. Artists set the angle/rotation/translation that the model should be displayed at in the item's config file, and lets the game engine take care of the rest. However, the artists have no control over how the game engine decides what to render and what to ignore on a pixel level when dealing with small details within a model.\n**The third kind of item graphic is equipment that is equipped on the player, which is a 3D model that is usually more detailed than the inventory/dropped appearance.\n**A fourth appearance for items is an appearance in a [[chatbox]], such as when an [[NPC]] gives you an item, and it appears as a larger version of the inventory icon (with textures).\n**In addition, some items may have graphics for other situations, such as animations, [[POH]] mountings, or the player's head when talking to an NPC. All of these graphics will usually look similar to each other, normally only varying in detail.\n*'''Name''': Most items have a unique name for that particular item. Some may have the same exact name, yet have different purposes.\n**Items in-game use ''ucfirst'' capitalisation, wherein the first letter of a string is capitalised, but the rest is not. For example, as an inventory item, ''[[TzTok-Jad]]'s'' pet is called ''[[Tzrek-jad]]'', but as a follower it's called ''TzRek-Jad''.\n**While items in-game can share the same name, such as \"Key\", every item has a distinct config name within the game's code. For example, the item \"[[Key (Witch's House)|Key]]\" used during the [[Witch's House]] [[quest]] has the config name \"<code>witches_shedkey</code>\", while the item \"[[Key (The Lost Tribe)|Key]] used during the [[The Lost Tribe]] [[quest]] has the config name \"<code>lost_tribe_chest_key</code>\". These config names are used by [[Jagex Moderator]]s to more easily identify items when creating or fixing content.\n*'''[[#Tradeability|Tradeability]]''': Many items may be [[traded]] between players; however, many [[quest]]-related, [[holiday]], and miscellaneous items cannot be traded (and cannot be transferred in any other way such as the [[Party Room]]) and therefore are often called [[untradeable]] items or non-tradeables. Almost all tradeable items may be traded on the [[Grand Exchange]] and therefore are associated with a certain price range of numbers of [[coins]], which can change when the Grand Exchange updates its prices. The only tradeable items that cannot be traded on the Grand Exchange are a very small number of useless items such as burnt fish. Naturally, coins are an item that cannot be bought on the Grand Exchange either as they are the main [[currency]] in ''Old School RuneScape''.\n*'''[[Weight]]''': All unstackable items have weight which affects the player's ability to [[run]]. The higher a player's weight, the faster they lose energy while running.\n*'''[[Stackable items|Item stacking]] (Stackability)''': Some items such as [[runes]] or [[coins]] will pile up in a single spot in the inventory. Other items such as [[bucket]]s will take one spot per item and therefore are non-stackable. All items that are \"stackable\" have zero weight. Most non-stackable items may be converted to a stackable form using a [[bank note]], but bank noted items lose most of their properties as they just become a piece of paper. Bank noted items may be deposited in the bank and then withdrawn back as usable, unnoted, non-stackable items.\n*'''Equippability''': Some items, such as [[weapons]] or [[armour]], can be worn, giving [[bonuses]] or penalties to different [[combat styles]]. Many equipped items also have other effects.\n*'''Coin value:''' Items that can be sold to a shop or that can have the [[spells]] [[High Alchemy]] or [[Low Level Alchemy]] cast on them have a value determining the number of coins players will get if they do one of these actions. Even if an item is untradeable, it sometimes may still be converted into coins via alchemy spells. An example of an item falling under this category is a partially [[degraded]] piece of [[Barrows equipment]] or the [[ecumenical key]].\n\n==Tradeability==\nNot every item in ''Old School RuneScape'' is [[tradeable]], and of the items that are, not every tradeable item is tradeable on the [[Grand Exchange]]. When ''RuneScape'' was first released, all items could be traded. However, many [[quest]] items were made non-tradeable following complaints in 2002 that this made quests too easy. Untradeable items are not limited to those used in quests; other items, such as [[clue scrolls]] are also untradeable.\n\nIn general, most tradeable items are tradeable on the Grand Exchange, however. The most common exception to this rule is [[coins]]. In general, almost every tradeable item has a \"drop\" option rather than a destroy option and will display itself on the ground. Exceptions exist (such as [[impling]]s in jars).\n\nTrivially, any tradeable item may be offered to another player via the trade screen, and this may be the only way to get items not available on the Grand Exchange.\n\nAs a basic rule, tradeable items share properties and they may be:\n\n*Traded to other players for coins or other items.\n*They will appear to other players on [[death]] or after the item is dropped onto the ground (some [[untradeable]] items are converted into coins or other items if the player dies in the [[Wilderness]]).\n*Sold to a [[general store]] or [[speciality shop]].\n*[[High Level Alchemy|High]] or [[Low Level Alchemy|Low-alched]] into coins.\n*Converted into [[Bank note|notes]].\n\nThe latter three rules, however, are not limited to tradeable items. Untradeable items may or may not be alchemiseable. Similarly, some tradeable items cannot be alchemised, such as [[membership bond]]s.\n\nEven if an item is tradeable, [[free players]] will not be able to trade it away to players nor a shop if it is a [[members]]-only item.\n\n==Dropping and destroying==\nMany items may be '''dropped''' on the ground. There is a limit to the number of items that can be dropped on the ground. Once 129 of the same item are dropped on the ground within the same game chunk, successive items of that same type dropped will not exceed the 129 limit within the squares of that game chunk. But instead, once additional of that same item are dropped, they begin to replace those already on the ground instead. Meaning, those on the ground are removed and replaced by those dropped instantly. This raises the possibility for one players items that are currently on the ground to be de-spawned by another player who might quickly drop enough items to reach the 129 item limit for that chunk. Items dropped on the ground disappear after a certain time. [[Tradeable]] items and items dropped by monsters appear to other [[player]]s 60 seconds after being dropped, and disappear after 120 seconds if not picked up. [[Untradeable]] items simply disappear 180 seconds after being dropped. Items placed on a table will disappear after 600 seconds if not picked up. Items dropped on [[Tutorial Island]] will disappear after 30 seconds.\n\nIf [[Ranged]] projectiles are dropped on the ground as a result of their usage, they appear to other players one at a time, and correspondingly disappear one at a time.\n\nSome items may not be dropped on the ground; they have no \"[[Drop]]\" option in their right-click menu. Instead, they have a \"[[Destroy (Action)|Destroy]]\" option, which allows the player to remove the item from their possession.\n\nThe '''destroy''' option was introduced with the [[Garden of Tranquillity]] quest. This is a feature in ''Old School RuneScape'' for certain [[quest]]-related items, [[discontinued items]], [[Achievement Diary]] item rewards and [[holiday]] drops that replaces the usual \"Drop\" option available to all other items. It most often applies to items which cannot be traded. There is usually a warning screen that appears when \"destroy\" option is selected that asks if the player is sure they want to destroy the item, and also explains how to get the item again (or that it cannot be re-obtained). [[Members]]-only items will always have a \"Drop\" option on [[free]] worlds; however, trying to drop the item will still trigger the dialogue box for destroying the item.\n\nMost modern holiday items, such as the [[chicken outfit]], can be destroyed and retrieved from [[Diango]] in [[Draynor Village]].\n\nSometimes, if a player wishes to drop a high-value item, a warning screen will appear. The item is not protected by anything, so other players will still see it after 60 seconds, and it will still disappear after an additional 60 seconds. Be careful of what you wish to drop.\n\n==Discontinuation==\nUnlike in its parent game [[rsw:RuneScape|RuneScape]], the team of [[Old School RuneScape]] have taken special care to prevent discontinued items. All [[holiday items]] are able to be reobtained every year at their respective holiday dates. Whenever an item is in fact discontinued, (e.g., the [[cabbage rune]], [[kristmas kebab]], and various other in-progress holiday event items), if the player has any of those items, they are removed from wherever they are stored.\n\nIn ''RuneScape'', discontinued items can fetch billions of [[gold pieces]]. Although the Old School team was at first unsure whether or not to repeat the behaviour of discontinuing holiday items and letting prices inflate, ultimately they decided, like Andrew Gower did in 2003, \"players hoarding huge numbers of the gifts we drop and then reselling them for massively unfair prices [...] isn't really in the spirit of the occasion.\"<ref>[[Update:Happy_Easter | Easter 2003 Newspost]]</ref> Given a fresh slate, the Old School team has been able to avoid that legacy mistake.\n\n==Categories==\n*[[:Category:Items|Items]]\n**[[:Category:Armour|Armour]] (page: [[Armour]])\n**[[:Category:Construction|Construction items]]\n**[[:Category:Crafting items|Crafting items]]\n**[[Concept:Discontinued items|Discontinued items]] (page:[[Discontinued items]])\n**[[:Category:Equipable items|Equipable items]]\n**[[:Category:Farming|Farming items]]\n**(page:[[Findable items]])\n**[[:Category:Firemaking|Firemaking items]]\n**[[:Category:Fishing|Fishing]]\n**[[:Category:Fletching|Fletching]]\n**[[:Category:Food|Food]]\n**[[:Category:Grand Exchange items|Grand Exchange items]]\n**[[:Category:Hunter|Hunter items]]\n**[[:Category:Mining|Mining items]]\n**[[:Category:Prayer items|Prayer items]]\n**[[:Category:Runecraft|Runecraft items]]\n**[[:Category:Smithing|Smithing items]]\n**[[:Category:Untradeable items|Untradeable items]]\n**[[:Category:Quest items|Quest items]] (page: [[Quest items]])\n**[[:Category:Runes|Runes]] (page:[[Runes]])\n**[[:Category:Weapons|Weapons]] (page:[[Weapons]])\n**[[:Category:Woodcutting|Woodcutting items]]\n\n==Trivia==\n*If one selects the option to \"take\" an item, and the item disappears before reaching it (or picking it up), a message that says \"Too late - it's gone!\" will show in the chat box.\n*Items in the inventory will remain there even if the player is wielding them in an animation, such as [[woodcutting]] a [[yew]] tree.\n*The maximum amount of an item the player can have on an interface ([[bank]], [[inventory]], [[Grand Exchange]] slot, etc) is {{formatnum:{{#expr: 2^31-1}}}} due to the amount being stored as a signed 32-bit Integer. In the Java programming language, an integer has a maximum value of 2<sup>31</sup> - 1 or {{formatnum:{{#expr: 2^31-1}}}}, per the definition of a Java integer as 32 bits.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Items| ]]"}

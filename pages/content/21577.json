They once inhabited [[Camdozaal]], a now ruined-city below [[Ice Mountain]], but were believed to be extinct after the [[Runecrafting Crusades]]. They are well-known for their masterful smithing skill, having created the original sword of [[Sir Vyvin]]'s family and possibly the [[Shield of Arrav]], and their love of [[redberry pie]]. Additionally, most of the Imcando dwarves were followers of [[Saradomin]].\n\nUp to their destruction, the Imcando tribe were particularly skilled in [[Smithing]] weaponry, and possibly [[Mining]]. As mentioned above, the sword of [[Sir Vyvin]], passed down through five generations of his family, was forged by the Imcando, and the Shield of Arrav may have also been forged by them. For many hundreds of years, they were the world's most renowned smiths. The techniques used by the Imcando were secret, passed down from generation to generation, and any devices created by the Imcando are very hard to replicate.\n\nCurrently the only Imcando dwarves in-game are [[Thurgo]] and [[Ramarno]]. Thurgo can be found south of [[Port Sarim]] and north of [[Mudskipper Point]]. He is involved in [[The Knight's Sword]] and [[The Giant Dwarf]] quests. Ramarno is encountered at the end of the quest [[Below Ice Mountain]] and lives in the [[Ruins of Camdozaal]]. After the quest he can be found by the [[Sacred Forge]].\n\n==History==\n===Fall of Imcandoria and resettling===\nThe Imcando once lived in the great city of [[Imcandoria]] in the far north.{{CiteNPC|npc=Ghost (Ruins of Camdozaal)|quote=Rumour has it [the Imcando] once lived in a great city in the far north.}} Towards the end of the [[Second Age]], their city fell after a mysterious malevolent entity believed to be a part of {{RSL|Xau-Tak}} killed the inhabitants of the city and turned it into a frozen wasteland. With no home to return to,{{CiteNPC|npc=Ghost (Ruins of Camdozaal)|quote=The city [Imcandoria] fell and now they are homeless.}} the Imcando dwarves were promised a new home by [[Saradomin]],{{CiteNPC|npc=Ghost (Ruins of Camdozaal)|quote=It seems [the Imcando] have been promised a new home here in return for wiping us out.}} who would have his forces lay siege to [[Lassar]] and grant the Imcando dwarves a new settlement in the ruins of the fortress.\n\nLed by [[Yonrith Lovakengj]], the Saradominist forces marched upon Lassar and destroyed it in one of many attacks on the [[Zarosian Empire]] that began after the [[Betrayal of Zaros]]. Once the Zarosian forces have been driven out, the Imcando dwarves set to build their new city, naming it [[Camdozaal]].\n\n===Refuge westwards===\nYonrith Lovakengj, who fled westward with his closest allies,{{CiteNPC|npc=Ghost (Ruins of Camdozaal)|quote=Their leader is named Yonrith Lovakengj. He has fled to the west with his closest allies, but much of his army still remains.}} fled towards an uninhabited continent far west, and he eventually founded the city of [[Lovakengj]].\n\nEventually, a group of Imcando dwarves travelled further southwards from Lovakengj and founded a city underground in the [[Avium Savannah]], today a part of the kingdom of [[Varlamore]]. Towards the end of the [[Fourth Age]], they enlisted the help of an unnamed adventurer from [[Hosidius]] to help subdue a demon that was capable of summoning torrential rainstorms,{{CiteNPC|loc=Bloody diary|quote=I recall encountering a particularly nasty demon capable of summoning torrential rainstorms in the Avium Savannah. Being requested by a group of dwarves underground to quell the demon's rage...}} in which they forged a [[demonbane weapon]] to help the adventurer.{{CiteNPC|loc=Bloody diary|quote=...[the Imcando dwarves] forged me a silver sword combined with some mystical metal, which they claimed was carefully tuned to greatly harm demons.}}\n\nDuring this time, it is not known whether they had remained in contact with their Imcando brethren in Camdozaal, although today there are no Imcando dwarves present in [[Great Kourend]]. However, the city once had maintained contact with the dwarves of [[Lovakengj]], although they lost contact with them centuries ago,{{CitePostbag|issue=23|author=[[Lady Vulcana Lovakengj]]|letter=6|quote=There are a few other dwarves in Varlamore, but we haven’t been in contact for centuries, on account of all the assassinations and wars and such.}} presumably during the [[War of the Five Houses]].\n\n===Arrav of Avarrocka===\nBack in the mainland, [[Arrav]], after meeting [[Zemouregal]] in the [[Dream Land]], was sent by his village's elders to find the mythical Shield of Arrav, in the possession of the Imcando dwarves in [[Camdozaal]]. After wandering through what would later become [[Asgarnia]], Arrav settled at the foot of a mountain (possibly [[Ice Mountain]]) where he was greeted by several Imcando. Despite their refusals of knowing the Shield, Arrav stayed with them, hoping to gain their trust. After spending many days with the Imcando and learning their arts of mining and smithing, he was given the Shield.\n\n===Destruction of Camdozaal===\nCamdozaal would remain as the prosperous home of the Imcando until the early [[Fifth Age]], when a faction of [[Fremennik]]s sought to destroy any users of magic in the [[Runecrafting Crusades]]. With their inclusion of magic in dwarven smithing techniques,{{CiteNPC|npc=Ramarno|quote=Our methods would often differ from other dwarves. Whereas they just used traditional smithing techniques, we would combine them with magic as well.}} as well as experimentation with [[Golem (Ruins of Camdozaal)|golems]]{{CiteNPC|npc=Ramarno|quote=We used our advanced Smithing knowledge to improve their form. Eventually, we were able to get them working again. We kept pushing with the golems. Many of them we imbued with magical energies.}} left over from the Zarosian era,{{CiteNPC|npc=Ramarno|quote=Camdozaal was built upon the ruins of an older civilization. Little trace of them remained by the time we arrived. However, when building the city, ancient golems were discovered.}} the Fremennik turned their weapons toward Camdozaal.\n\nThe Imcando dwarves, believing their weapons to be strong enough to repel the invasion, were ultimately wiped out.{{CiteNPC|npc=Ramarno|quote=We learned of a horde of barbarians pillaging across the land, hunting down and killing anyone who dared use magic. We underestimated them. We believed our weapons would be enough to keep us safe. We were wrong. The barbarians brought ruin upon Camdozaal.}} Today, they are now largely believed to be extinct, with [[Ramarno]] and [[Thurgo]] being the sole remaining Imcando dwarves on the mainland. From conversations with them, it appears that they are not yet aware of their fellow Imcando brethren beneath the [[Avium Savannah]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{The Legend of Arrav}}\n[[Category:Dwarves]]\n[[Category:Races]]"}

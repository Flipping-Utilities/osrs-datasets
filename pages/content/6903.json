The <a href=\"/w/Nature_Spirit\" title=\"Nature Spirit\">Nature Spirit</a> quest may need to be started if you need to go through <a href=\"/w/Mort_Myre_Swamp\" title=\"Mort Myre Swamp\">Mort Myre Swamp</a> and cannot use <a href=\"/w/Fairy_rings\" title=\"Fairy rings\">fairy rings</a>. From <a href=\"/w/Canifis\" title=\"Canifis\">Canifis</a>, head west and enter the swamps through the gate. Travel south along the <a href=\"/w/River_Salve\" title=\"River Salve\">River Salve</a>. Begin along the long winding path to <a href=\"/w/Mort%27ton\" title=\"Mort&#39;ton\">Mort'ton</a>. At the most south-west part of the path is the starting point of this quest. Look for a grey field on the minimap.\n</p><p>The fastest way to reach the Haunted Mine is by teleporting to <a href=\"/w/Mort%27ton\" title=\"Mort&#39;ton\">Mort'ton</a> with a <a href=\"/w/Mort%27ton_teleport\" title=\"Mort&#39;ton teleport\">Mort'ton teleport</a> scroll (which is tradeable), or a <a href=\"/w/Shades_of_Mort%27ton_(minigame)\" title=\"Shades of Mort&#39;ton (minigame)\">Shades of Mort'ton minigame</a> <a href=\"/w/Minigame_teleport\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Minigame teleport\">teleport</a>, which requires completion of the <a href=\"/w/Shades_of_Mort%27ton\" title=\"Shades of Mort&#39;ton\">Shades of Mort'ton</a> quest. A significantly cheaper but slightly slower option is to use a <a href=\"/w/Barrows_Teleport\" title=\"Barrows Teleport\">Barrows Teleport</a> tablet. From Mort'ton, head west and follow the winding paths to the mine. Alternatively, if <a href=\"/w/In_Aid_of_the_Myreque\" title=\"In Aid of the Myreque\">In Aid of the Myreque</a> has been completed up to a certain point, use the shortcut in <a href=\"/w/Burgh_de_Rott\" title=\"Burgh de Rott\">Burgh de Rott</a>'s western fence, but beware of <a href=\"/w/Feral_vampyre\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Feral vampyre\">feral vampyres</a>. It is also possible, albeit rare, for <a href=\"/w/Loar_Shade\" title=\"Loar Shade\">Loar Shades</a> to wander into this area.\n</p><p>Travel times may moreover be shortened by using the following <a href=\"/w/Fairy_ring\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fairy ring\">fairy ring</a> codes:\n</p>\n<ul><li><span class=\"fairycode\"><b>c</b><b>k</b><b>s</b></span> - West of <a href=\"/w/Canifis\" title=\"Canifis\">Canifis</a>, at the entrance gate of the swamp.</li>\n<li><span class=\"fairycode\"><b>b</b><b>k</b><b>r</b></span> - South of Canifis, a short way into the swamp.</li>\n<li><span class=\"fairycode\"><b>b</b><b>i</b><b>p</b></span> - On an island west of the <a href=\"/w/Nature_Grotto\" title=\"Nature Grotto\">Nature Grotto</a>, which lies in the southern part of the swamp. You'll need level 50 <a href=\"/w/Agility\" title=\"Agility\">Agility</a> to cross a stepping stone to get to <a href=\"/w/Morytania\" title=\"Morytania\">Morytania</a>.</li></ul>\n<p>For the boss fight, high level food is strongly recommended, as you will take a lot of damage at all levels.

He demands to know your allegiance. Tell him either you are on the path of <a href=\"/w/Saradomin\" title=\"Saradomin\">Saradomin</a> or <a href=\"/w/Guthix\" title=\"Guthix\">Guthix</a> or have no particular allegiance, then ask about what he is doing in the name of the god of wisdom. (He will be less than friendly if you state you are <a href=\"/w/Zamorak\" title=\"Zamorak\">Zamorakian</a> and send you away.) He divulges he is on a quest to strengthen Saradomin's name in Morytania, explaining that you are standing atop the now abandoned Mort Ridge Mines that used to be exploited by the Morytanians until the <a href=\"/w/Misthalin_-_Morytania_War\" title=\"Misthalin - Morytania War\">Misthalin - Morytania War</a> and the blessing of the <a href=\"/w/River_Salve\" title=\"River Salve\">River Salve</a>. The mine is also said to contain the legendary <a href=\"/w/Salve_amulet\" title=\"Salve amulet\">Salve amulet</a>, carved from the crystals that grow within due to the blessed river water seeping through the rock. This Salve amulet is said to afford its bearer power over <a href=\"/w/Undead\" title=\"Undead\">evil</a>, wherefore the zealot seeks to gain access to the mines and craft another.\n</p><p>He moreover adds that the mine is haunted; it was once protected by a Zamorakian mage named <a href=\"/w/Treus_Dayth\" title=\"Treus Dayth\">Treus Dayth</a>, who was slain by Saradominists that managed to make off with a shard of crystal. The livid chaos god is said to then have cursed Dayth's soul and bound it to the crystals to prevent their being reached again. Moreover, following this incident, <a href=\"/w/Lowerniel_Drakan\" title=\"Lowerniel Drakan\">the ruler of the land</a> ordered the mines to be sealed and everyone within to be slaughtered due to the crystals' effects. Rather than risk losing their workforce to the Saradominists, the Morytanians brutally killed them. The victims' souls are now rumoured to haunt the mine.\n</p><p>Ask about other entrances into the mine. The zealot confirms a second entrance may exist and has come into possession of a key granting access to the lower levels of the mine. He is still trying to work out where the second entrance may be, but remarks it was not made for humans. Ask him whether you may borrow the key; he refuses, saying the mission can only be entrusted to himself. No matter how much you attempt to persuade him, he will not part with the key.\n</p><p><a href=\"/w/Pickpocket\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pickpocket\">Pickpocket</a> him to get <a href=\"/w/Zealot%27s_key\" title=\"Zealot&#39;s key\">his key</a>, which is needed later in the quest. Do not forget to get this, or you will have to come back for it later.\n</p><p>Walk south of the unfortunate cleric to the cart track; do not descend the stone stairs for you will be met by locked doors. Beware of the <a href=\"/w/Feral_vampyre\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Feral vampyre\">feral vampyres</a> on the prowl. Climb over the second-to-last cart, then walk past the last cart and crawl through the cart tunnel.

It shows a map of all the cart tracks on this level as well as ten junctions that can each be in two positions. Pressing the red start button sets the cart system in motion. The objective is to get the cart from the start position on the left to the exit point at the ladder in the top right corner (north-west). If you fail, you can simply retry but you will need to replace the fungus.\n</p><p>The map also shows two groups of levers controlling the junctions. Examining them reveals to which they correspond. The levers A through E are south-east of the control panel (location <b>(Q)</b> on the map above), whereas F through J are north, around the corner (location <b>(R)</b>). Beware of skeletal miners lying in ambush at both stations. In order to get the cart towards the correct exit, study the route map carefully. The levers F, G and H <b>cannot</b> be pulled, as they are inaccessible. These junctions are therefore fixed, limiting your options. The cart will follow the <i>crimson</i> route at any junction when approaching from the tail direction of the corresponding arrow. Pulling the respective lever exchanges the crimson and burgundy arrows at the junction. When approaching a junction from the arrow head's direction, its orientation (i.e., colour) does not matter <i>as long as it is a straight path</i>. In order to round a corner and not plunge into a wall or the water, the direction taken by the cart must be marked by a crimson arrow.\n</p>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\">\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 335px\"><div style=\"width: 335px\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 330px;\"><div style=\"margin:15px auto;\"><a href=\"/w/File:Haunted_Mine_-_Levers_A-E.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/Haunted_Mine_-_Levers_A-E.png/183px-Haunted_Mine_-_Levers_A-E.png?456a4\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"183\" height=\"120\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/Haunted_Mine_-_Levers_A-E.png/275px-Haunted_Mine_-_Levers_A-E.png?456a4 1.5x, /images/thumb/Haunted_Mine_-_Levers_A-E.png/366px-Haunted_Mine_-_Levers_A-E.png?456a4 2x\" data-file-width=\"514\" data-file-height=\"337\" /></a></div></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n<p>Levers A-E.\n</p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div></li>\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 335px\"><div style=\"width: 335px\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 330px;\"><div style=\"margin:15px auto;\"><a href=\"/w/File:Haunted_Mine_-_Levers_I-K.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/Haunted_Mine_-_Levers_I-K.png/184px-Haunted_Mine_-_Levers_I-K.png?8442c\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"184\" height=\"120\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/Haunted_Mine_-_Levers_I-K.png/276px-Haunted_Mine_-_Levers_I-K.png?8442c 1.5x, /images/thumb/Haunted_Mine_-_Levers_I-K.png/368px-Haunted_Mine_-_Levers_I-K.png?8442c 2x\" data-file-width=\"516\" data-file-height=\"337\" /></a></div></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n<p>Levers F-K.

Click the chatbox to continue the dialogue and the ghost of <a href=\"/w/Treus_Dayth\" title=\"Treus Dayth\">Treus Dayth</a> (combat level 95), the erstwhile guardian of the Salve crystals, will appear and start to attack you! He will be identified on the minimap as a flashing yellow arrow. He will use his ghostly powers to move through obstacles about the room and mainly attack you with his ranged attack and possessed machinery, When chasing Treus Dayth, try to stay out of the way of the moving carts and the cranes.\n</p><p>The ghost itself is not that strong, but the damage from the environment can be serious. The ghost will continually become invisible and move to another part of the chamber after some hits are dealt — and the more the fight progresses, the sooner he will move, sometimes even after one hit, which is where weapons with a high maximum hit comes in handy — which makes killing this boss very difficult without <a href=\"/w/Energy_potion\" title=\"Energy potion\">energy</a>/<a href=\"/w/Super_energy\" title=\"Super energy\">super energy</a> potions. Whilst invisible, he cannot be attacked, but a yellow arrow indicates where he is. A large supply of food and optionally potions is advised depending on your combat level. An emergency teleport (a ring of life or the <a href=\"/w/Ectophial\" title=\"Ectophial\">Ectophial</a>) is very useful too.\n</p><p>During the fight, carts and cranes around the room will start to operate and can cause major harm, so players should avoid them when possible. The cranes are stationary and can hit hard, but they are inaccurate and easily avoided by staying out of their reach. The carts can only move along the track they are on, similar to the other carts in the dungeon. However, these carts are dangerous because they can hit rapidly, dealing up to 9 damage every tick while dragging a player along the track. Additionally, <a href=\"/w/Pickaxe\" title=\"Pickaxe\">pickaxes</a> will be <b>constantly</b> thrown at the player during the fight, hitting as much as 15 damage in one attack. <a href=\"/w/Protect_from_Missiles\" title=\"Protect from Missiles\">Protect from Missiles</a> is recommended for this fight, although it <b>only provides 33% protection</b> against the pickaxes, reducing their max hit to 10 damage. Magic attacks are very effective against the boss. Killing Treus Dayth counts towards ghost slayer tasks. A kill will grant 100 slayer xp.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Strategy\">Strategy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/Haunted_Mine?section=11&amp;veaction=edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: Strategy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/w/Haunted_Mine?action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Strategy\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>A highly viable strategy for low to mid-level players who can equip <a href=\"/w/Iban%27s_staff\" title=\"Iban&#39;s staff\">Iban's staff</a> (requiring 50 <a href=\"/w/Attack\" title=\"Attack\">Attack</a>, <a href=\"/w/Magic\" title=\"Magic\">Magic</a>, and completion of <a href=\"/w/Underground_Pass\" title=\"Underground Pass\">Underground Pass</a>) is to use <a href=\"/w/Iban_Blast\" title=\"Iban Blast\">Iban Blast</a>, as it hits accurately (especially against this boss) and very high. If using <a href=\"/w/Melee\" title=\"Melee\">Melee</a>, bring the highest-hitting <a href=\"/w/Melee_weapon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Melee weapon\">melee weapon</a> you can use, such as a <a href=\"/w/2h_sword\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"2h sword\">2h sword</a> or <a href=\"/w/Halberd\" title=\"Halberd\">halberd</a>, as this boss has a high chance to teleport somewhere else after being hit.\n</p><p><b>Tip</b>: If things get heavy and too difficult, you can walk out by the door on the east and easily manage health and <a href=\"/w/Prayer\" title=\"Prayer\">prayer</a> there. The boss will not reset and still have the same amount of health as when you left the door.\n</p><p>It is <b>not</b> possible to freeze the ghost from moving using Magic or the Zamorak Godsword special attack. <a href=\"/w/Crumble_Undead\" title=\"Crumble Undead\">Crumble Undead</a> works well against him, <b>but be advised</b> that a <a href=\"/w/Skull_sceptre_(i)\" title=\"Skull sceptre (i)\">Skull sceptre (i)</a> (<b>Must be imbued</b> otherwise no requirements to wield), <a href=\"/w/Slayer%27s_staff\" title=\"Slayer&#39;s staff\">Slayer Staff</a> (requiring 55 Slayer + 50 Magic) or a <a href=\"/w/Void_knight_mace\" title=\"Void knight mace\">Void Knight Mace</a> (costing 250 <a href=\"/w/Pest_Control\" title=\"Pest Control\">Pest Control</a> points &amp; requiring 42 Melee, Ranged, Magic, and 22 Prayer) are three of the lowest requirement weapons with which you can autocast Crumble. A <a href=\"/w/Trident_of_the_seas\" title=\"Trident of the seas\">trident of the seas</a> and <a href=\"/w/Trident_of_the_swamp\" title=\"Trident of the swamp\">trident of the swamp</a> are also good options.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/w/File:Haunted_Mine_-_Fighting_Treus_Dayth.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/Haunted_Mine_-_Fighting_Treus_Dayth.png/300px-Haunted_Mine_-_Fighting_Treus_Dayth.png?f634d\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"208\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/Haunted_Mine_-_Fighting_Treus_Dayth.png/450px-Haunted_Mine_-_Fighting_Treus_Dayth.png?f634d 1.5x, /images/thumb/Haunted_Mine_-_Fighting_Treus_Dayth.png/600px-Haunted_Mine_-_Fighting_Treus_Dayth.png?f634d 2x\" data-file-width=\"783\" data-file-height=\"543\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/w/File:Haunted_Mine_-_Fighting_Treus_Dayth.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Fighting <a href=\"/w/Treus_Dayth\" title=\"Treus Dayth\">Treus Dayth</a>.</div></div></div>\n<p>An example strategy that works quite well: bring a 4-dose <a href=\"/w/Prayer_potion\" title=\"Prayer potion\">Prayer potion</a>, optionally a <a href=\"/w/Ranging_potion\" title=\"Ranging potion\">Ranging potion</a>, and the best <a href=\"/w/Ranged_weapon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ranged weapon\">Ranged weaponry</a> you can muster, along with an inventory filled with food. Use Protect from Missiles at all times. When you reach Treus Dayth, switch on <a href=\"/w/Eagle_Eye\" title=\"Eagle Eye\">Eagle Eye</a> to make your shots count, shoot, and then switch it off when he moves away (keep Protect from Missiles on). He likes moving between the north-western and north-eastern side of the room, in which case you are recommended to run along the northern-most cart track in the detached tunnel, where you only have to dodge one cart. If he moves south, try to hug the cavern walls to avoid the cranes as you approach him. However, don't hesitate while fighting — it's better to take a bit of extra damage and be faster than be indecisive and suffer as a result. Before fighting, you are also recommended to explore the room and practice how you are going to move around without taking too much damage — the machinery doesn't activate before the fight.\n</p><p>Using a <a href=\"/w/Dragon_dagger\" title=\"Dragon dagger\">dragon dagger</a> is also a good alternative. Its <a href=\"/w/Special_attack\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Special attack\">special attack</a> hits twice in one go, but this boss will only receive one of those hits before he moves away to a new spot and before you even get to him the second attack from the dagger will automatically hit him. You can keep using this tactic on the boss with minimum movement as you can use the dragon dagger's special attack numerous times during the fight.\n</p><p>A good mid-tier magic attack that works effectively is <a href=\"/w/Iban_Blast\" title=\"Iban Blast\">Iban Blast</a>, or even <a href=\"/w/Fire_Bolt\" title=\"Fire Bolt\">Fire Bolt</a> wearing <a href=\"/w/Chaos_gauntlets\" title=\"Chaos gauntlets\">chaos gauntlets</a> on the cheap. The only downside to magic is that <a href=\"/w/Magic_armour\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Magic armour\">magic armour</a> provides very little Ranged Defence; however, since the boss has negative magic defence, you can have a negative magic attack bonus of -35 or higher and still hit consistently. This allows for a set such as <a href=\"/w/Rune_platebody\" title=\"Rune platebody\">rune platebody</a>/<a href=\"/w/Rune_platelegs\" title=\"Rune platelegs\">platelegs</a>/<a href=\"/w/Rune_kiteshield\" title=\"Rune kiteshield\">kiteshield</a>, <a href=\"/w/Farseer_helm\" title=\"Farseer helm\">farseer helm</a>, <a href=\"/w/Amulet_of_glory\" title=\"Amulet of glory\">amulet of glory</a>, <a href=\"/w/Barrows_gloves\" title=\"Barrows gloves\">Recipe for Disaster gloves</a>/chaos gauntlets, and <a href=\"/w/Boots_of_lightness\" title=\"Boots of lightness\">boots of lightness</a> with Iban's staff/<a href=\"/w/Elemental_staff\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Elemental staff\">elemental staff</a> to be an effective set both for damage and defence against the boss. Combined with decent food/prayer potions, you should be able to kill this boss fairly easy by just <a href=\"/w/Praying_range\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Praying range\">praying range</a> and running back and forth along the northern tunnel if possible.\n</p><p>If you die, your items will appear on the ground until you return.<sup class=\"noprint fact\">&#91;<span class=\"fact-text\" title=\"This fact is likely to be disputed and needs a source for confirmation.\">confirmation needed</span>&#93;</sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Salvation_at_last\">Salvation at last</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/Haunted_Mine?section=12&amp;veaction=edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: Salvation at last\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/w/Haunted_Mine?action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Salvation at last\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/w/File:Haunted_Mine_-_Crystal_mine.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/Haunted_Mine_-_Crystal_mine.png/220px-Haunted_Mine_-_Crystal_mine.png?a8bd7\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"220\" height=\"134\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/Haunted_Mine_-_Crystal_mine.png/330px-Haunted_Mine_-_Crystal_mine.png?a8bd7 1.5x, /images/thumb/Haunted_Mine_-_Crystal_mine.png/440px-Haunted_Mine_-_Crystal_mine.png?a8bd7 2x\" data-file-width=\"1857\" data-file-height=\"1130\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/w/File:Haunted_Mine_-_Crystal_mine.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The long sought-after Salve crystals.</div></div></div>\n<p>After defeating <a href=\"/w/Treus_Dayth\" title=\"Treus Dayth\">Treus Dayth</a>, the machinery will stop attacking you.

It is similar in terms of gameplay to [[Underground Pass]], relying mainly on the player's own aptitude for exploration and aiming to instil an eerie atmosphere throughout.\n\nWhilst the quest is standalone, it does reveal some backstory related to [[Morytania]] and [[Lord Drakan]].\n\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Speak to the [[Zealot]] at the mines in [[Morytania]] on the path to Mort'ton.\n|difficulty = 3\n|description = Recent forays into Morytania by some of Saradomin's more fanatical supporters have unearthed murky rumours concerning an abandoned mine in the south.\n\nLegend speaks of an unusual material, hidden in the depths of the mines, that is somehow linked to the desolation and fear that now surrounds the place. Do you have the nerve to find out more, and enter the haunted mines of Morytania?\n|length = Short\n|requirements = \n* Completion of {{SCP|Quest}} [[Priest in Peril]]\n* {{SCP|Crafting|35||link=yes}} {{Boostable|yes}}\n* The ability to defeat a level 95 enemy\n|items = \n* A [[chisel]] (can be acquired during the quest)\n|recommended = \n* {{SCP|Combat|50|link=yes}}\n* {{SCP|Agility|15|link=yes}} {{Boostable|Yes}} if climbing over the mine cart and crawling down the cart tunnel of the front entrance\n* Completion of {{SCP|Quest}} [[Nature Spirit]] for access to [[Druid pouch]] or [[Fire pit]] for Fires of Dehumidification.\n* {{SCP|Prayer|40|link=yes}}\n* A [[Dramen staff|Dramen]] or [[Lunar staff]] (only if you cannot reach the starting location through the [[Shades of Mort'ton (minigame)|Shades of Mort'ton minigame]] teleport or a [[Mort'ton teleport]] scroll. You can use the [[fairy ring]] {{fairycode|BIP}} (requires {{SCP|Agility|50|link=yes}}) to teleport near to the quest start.).\n* 1 [[Super energy]] potion if low [[Agility]] ([[Stamina potion]] is ''HIGHLY'' recommended)\n* A [[ball of wool]] ''(Optional, required to create [[salve amulet]] AFTER quest, NOT needed DURING quest)''\n* A [[pickaxe]] to mine mithril ore after the quest (for the hard [[Morytania Diary]]) (several low-tier pickaxe spawns throughout the mine)\n* A [[Slayer Ring]] for easy completion of the [[Lair of Tarn Razorlor]] miniquest after completing [[Haunted Mine]].\n\nThe boss fight at the end of the quest is '''considerably''' more difficult than the boss's combat level may suggest. It is highly recommended to bring:\n* Good combat equipment (at least level 50 is advised)\n* 1-2 [[prayer potion]]s\n* Combat stat boosting [[potions]] (depending on your [[attack style]])\n* ''Plenty'' of good [[food]] is strongly recommended for all levels, regardless of equipment and [[Defence]]\n* 2 empty inventory spaces, one for [[Zealot's key]] and one for the [[glowing fungus]]\n* [[Magic]] is recommended — see the [[Haunted_mine#Treus's wrath|boss section]] of the guide for more details\n* It can be useful to bring either a (additional) [[melee weapon]] with high [[Strength#Strength bonus|Strength bonuses]], [[Ranged]] [[ammunition]] with high [[Ranged Strength]] bonuses, or high-hitting [[Magic]] [[spells]]. Take something with a high maximum hit. (High-hitting [[special attacks]] are recommended.)\n|kills = \n* [[Treus Dayth]] ''(level 95)''\n}}\n\n==Walkthrough==\n===Reaching the mine===\n{{Map|3440,3232|mtype=square|r=6|align=right|caption=The [[Abandoned Mine]] is located south-west of [[Mort Myre Swamp]].}}\nTo begin the quest, players need to head to the [[Abandoned Mine]], which can be found in the south-westernmost part of Morytania, south of the swamps. The [[Nature Spirit]] quest may need to be started if you need to go through [[Mort Myre Swamp]] and cannot use [[fairy rings]]. From [[Canifis]], head west and enter the swamps through the gate. Travel south along the [[River Salve]]. Begin along the long winding path to [[Mort'ton]]. At the most south-west part of the path is the starting point of this quest. Look for a grey field on the minimap.\n\nThe fastest way to reach the Haunted Mine is by teleporting to [[Mort'ton]] with a [[Mort'ton teleport]] scroll (which is tradeable), or a [[Shades of Mort'ton (minigame)|Shades of Mort'ton minigame]] [[minigame teleport|teleport]], which requires completion of the [[Shades of Mort'ton]] quest. A significantly cheaper but slightly slower option is to use a [[Barrows Teleport]] tablet. From Mort'ton, head west and follow the winding paths to the mine. Alternatively, if [[In Aid of the Myreque]] has been completed up to a certain point, use the shortcut in [[Burgh de Rott]]'s western fence, but beware of [[feral vampyre]]s. It is also possible, albeit rare, for [[Loar Shade]]s to wander into this area.\n\nTravel times may moreover be shortened by using the following [[fairy ring]] codes:\n\n*{{Fairycode|cks}} - West of [[Canifis]], at the entrance gate of the swamp.\n*{{Fairycode|bkr}} - South of Canifis, a short way into the swamp.\n*{{Fairycode|bip}} - On an island west of the [[Nature Grotto]], which lies in the southern part of the swamp. You'll need level 50 [[Agility]] to cross a stepping stone to get to [[Morytania]].\n\nFor the boss fight, high level food is strongly recommended, as you will take a lot of damage at all levels. If you have no previous experience (or limited memory) of the fight, read the \"[[#The boss fight|boss fight]]\" section below in the quest guide. It is important to be well-prepared for the fight! Bring all the items required to finish the quest, including supplies for the boss fight (don't forget to bring a [[druid pouch]] if travelling through the swamps and not having lit the [[Fire pit|Fire of Dehumidification]]).\n\n===The mysteries of Mort Ridge===\n[[File:Zealot chathead.png|left]]\n[[File:Haunted Mine - Zealot.png|thumb|The [[zealot]] tells you about the mine and its contents.]]\nIn the area between the mine and the swamps, a Saradominist [[zealot]] is walking around. He demands to know your allegiance. Tell him either you are on the path of [[Saradomin]] or [[Guthix]] or have no particular allegiance, then ask about what he is doing in the name of the god of wisdom. (He will be less than friendly if you state you are [[Zamorak]]ian and send you away.) He divulges he is on a quest to strengthen Saradomin's name in Morytania, explaining that you are standing atop the now abandoned Mort Ridge Mines that used to be exploited by the Morytanians until the [[Misthalin - Morytania War]] and the blessing of the [[River Salve]]. The mine is also said to contain the legendary [[Salve amulet]], carved from the crystals that grow within due to the blessed river water seeping through the rock. This Salve amulet is said to afford its bearer power over [[undead|evil]], wherefore the zealot seeks to gain access to the mines and craft another.\n\nHe moreover adds that the mine is haunted; it was once protected by a Zamorakian mage named [[Treus Dayth]], who was slain by Saradominists that managed to make off with a shard of crystal. The livid chaos god is said to then have cursed Dayth's soul and bound it to the crystals to prevent their being reached again. Moreover, following this incident, [[Lowerniel Drakan|the ruler of the land]] ordered the mines to be sealed and everyone within to be slaughtered due to the crystals' effects. Rather than risk losing their workforce to the Saradominists, the Morytanians brutally killed them. The victims' souls are now rumoured to haunt the mine.\n\nAsk about other entrances into the mine. The zealot confirms a second entrance may exist and has come into possession of a key granting access to the lower levels of the mine. He is still trying to work out where the second entrance may be, but remarks it was not made for humans. Ask him whether you may borrow the key; he refuses, saying the mission can only be entrusted to himself. No matter how much you attempt to persuade him, he will not part with the key.\n\n[[Pickpocket]] him to get [[Zealot's key|his key]], which is needed later in the quest. Do not forget to get this, or you will have to come back for it later.\n\nWalk south of the unfortunate cleric to the cart track; do not descend the stone stairs for you will be met by locked doors. Beware of the [[feral vampyre]]s on the prowl. Climb over the second-to-last cart, then walk past the last cart and crawl through the cart tunnel. If you don't have 15 Agility to climb over the cart, go to the west side of the mountain instead and enter the northern entrance.\n\n===Into the depths===\n{{main|Abandoned Mine}}\n\nYou find yourself in a dark cave with many bats big and small and many pickaxes and corpses strewn about. Some skeletons are dormant; the ones called [[corpse]]s in yellow letters spring alive as [[skeletal miner]]s when you approach. Similarly, some pickaxes may become [[Possessed pickaxe|possessed]] and attack you when you pick them up. Throughout the mine, you will also encounter many creepy [[haze]]s. They are spooky but harmless, although they can sometimes turn into aggressive [[ghost]]s when adjacent. Your task is to make your way to the depths of the caves and find the Salve crystal. Make sure to avoid any mine carts moving on their own accord; they will damage you if you get in their way.\n\nIn the cave, follow the cart track west. Ignore the two ladders going down, continue west and crawl-through the cart tunnel to end up outside next to the [[River Salve]]. Walk south following the tracks to a second cave entrance. Once inside, go east. You will find a ladder at the end of the blocked path. Go down the ladder to the next level in the cave.\n\nHead directly east and go down another ladder.\n\nFollow the path to the cart track running north to south. Do not get hit by the mine cart that is moving along on the track. Wait for the cart to head south. Follow the cart south and wait in the alcove on the west side of the track. When the cart passes north, run south to the ladder. Climb down another level, the fourth.\n\n[[File:Abandoned Mine - Level 4 map.png|thumb|220px|A map of the fourth level.]]\nThe fourth level of the cave has several landmarks which are marked on the map to the right. The corresponding letters show the locations of each landmark.\n\n*'''(X)''' The [[Glowing fungus|glowing fungi]]\n*'''(P)''' The point-set panel (map of mine tracks)\n*'''(T)''' The cart\n*'''(Q)''' The levers A, B, C, D, and E\n*'''(R)''' The levers F, G, H, I, J, and K\n*'''(U)''' The water valve\n*'''(A)''' A [[chisel]] spawn\n*'''(13)''' The water-powered lift\n[[File:Glowing fungi.png|thumb|A cluster of fungi in a stagnant pool.]]\nShould you head down farther by going down ladders instead of taking the route taking you outside and make use of the lift, you will end up in a flooded, dark cave. The water extinguishes any [[light sources]] you might have and [[Damp tinderbox|ruins tinderboxes]]. You will therefore need something to be able to see further into the cave. Fortunately, the cave described above is abundant with [[Glowing fungus|luminescent fungi]] that could well do this for you. Unfortunately, the mushrooms disintegrate when taken outside the cave, not able to withstand being exposed even the dimmed daylight of Morytania. As such, you shall have to transport a fungus to the flooded level without actually carrying it.\n\n===Getting a light===\nYou are currently at Ladder '''(12)''' in the south part of the map. Head west and pick a [[glowing fungus]] '''(X)''' growing in the pools around you.\n\nThe glowing fungus is the light source required to access the deepest level of the mines. As daylight exposure will cause them to crumble to [[ashes]], do '''not''' take glowing fungi outside of the cave. '''Random events that teleport players to another area''' (e.g. [[Quiz Master]]) '''will also cause the fungi to turn to ash.''' Be sure to dismiss them as soon as they appear. Instead, the complex system of mine carts will be used to transport the fungi light source to the correct part of the cave.\n\n:'''Note:''' If you die during the boss fight, you will need to get another glowing fungus and send it through the mine cart again, but you will not need to set the levers again as they will remain the same.\n\nAfter picking a [[glowing fungus]] '''(X)''', continue north-west. On the west side of a pool, alongside four crates, is a searchable cart. Place the fungus in the cart '''(T)'''.\n\n'''Warning!''' Do not at any point drop the glowing fungus as it will crumble to dust and you will have to retrieve another one.\n\n====All aboard!====\nFrom the mine cart, head north and then west to the track map '''(P)''', which operates the cart system. Click the [[points settings]] panel on the northern wall of the corridor. It shows a map of all the cart tracks on this level as well as ten junctions that can each be in two positions. Pressing the red start button sets the cart system in motion. The objective is to get the cart from the start position on the left to the exit point at the ladder in the top right corner (north-west). If you fail, you can simply retry but you will need to replace the fungus.\n\nThe map also shows two groups of levers controlling the junctions. Examining them reveals to which they correspond. The levers A through E are south-east of the control panel (location '''(Q)''' on the map above), whereas F through J are north, around the corner (location '''(R)'''). Beware of skeletal miners lying in ambush at both stations. In order to get the cart towards the correct exit, study the route map carefully. The levers F, G and H '''cannot''' be pulled, as they are inaccessible. These junctions are therefore fixed, limiting your options. The cart will follow the ''crimson'' route at any junction when approaching from the tail direction of the corresponding arrow. Pulling the respective lever exchanges the crimson and burgundy arrows at the junction. When approaching a junction from the arrow head's direction, its orientation (i.e., colour) does not matter ''as long as it is a straight path''. In order to round a corner and not plunge into a wall or the water, the direction taken by the cart must be marked by a crimson arrow.\n\n<gallery widths=\"300\">\nHaunted Mine - Levers A-E.png|Levers A-E.\nHaunted Mine - Levers I-K.png|Levers F-K. (The blocked levers F, G & H are unmarked in this picture.)\nHaunted Mine - Track map.png|The mine cart route solution.\n</gallery>\n\nOperate all the levers in accordance with the rules above and then check the control panel to make sure that the route on your map directs the mine cart to the ladder. Operate the mine cart by pressing the red button and the map will show the path of the mine cart.\n\nIf a setting is incorrect, the cart ends up in the wrong location. When that happens, the [[glowing fungus]] is removed from the cart. In that case, pick another glowing fungus and put it in the cart '''(T)'''. Operate the appropriate levers to fix the problem and hit the red button again.\n\nWhen the mine cart reaches the correct end point, you will remark that it may have ended up somewhere useful. If your character doesn't make a comment about the location of the cart, put another mushroom in and send the cart off again.\n\n====Retrieving the fungus====\nYou will now have to reach the ladder yourself to retrieve the fungus. First, retrace your steps to the very top of the mine. Go back up the ladder '''(12)''' near the [[Glowing fungus|glowing fungi]] pool. Walk north along the track, avoiding the cart. Take the first path to the east and climb up the ladder at the end of the path. Go west and up the ladder, then exit the cave to the [[River Salve]].\n\nYou are now outside again and any fungi you have on you will crumble to ash. Go north and enter the northern cave. Climb down the first ladder immediately to the east and head north-east through the cave. Climb down the ladder to the next level. Head west to the '''north-west corner''' of the cave and climb down the ladder.\n\nSearch the nearby cart and take the glowing fungus that was put in earlier. Don't lose or drop the fungus until you have completed the quest! If you drop the fungus, it will disintegrate and you have to reobtain one. If there is no fungus in the cart, repeat the previous process starting by placing a new glowing fungus in the cart '''(T)'''.\n\nClimb back up with the fungus in your possession. There is a mine cart track leading south. Do '''not''' take this route; the only ladder you will be able to access, in the south-west, does not lead anywhere useful (namely, across the  pool with fungi).\n\n===Waterlogged===\n'''''Items required:''' Zealot's key, good [[armour]] and a good [[weapon]], plenty of high-healing [[food]]. In addition to this, a [[super energy]] potion, or even better yet, a [[stamina potion]], is highly recommended since killing the [[Treus Dayth|ghost]] requires a lot of running! An emergency teleport may be useful too.''\n\nInstead, head all the way east past the ladder going up and then south past a moving cart. Climb down the ladder to end up in a side cave east of the flooded tracks.\n\nHead south down the corridor. Pick up the [[chisel]] from the spawn on top of a crate if you did not bring one. There is a water-powered lift going further down but it isn't working. There is a water valve next to it, at the other side of a large pipe, which requires turning in order to power the lift. Locate the water valve and attempt to turn it; it's locked but there is a small keyhole in its side.\n[[File:Abandoned Mine flooded chamber.png|thumb|Taking a swim from the lift.]]\nUse the [[zealot's key]] on the valve to activate the water flow from the nearby basin. Make sure you have sufficient [[run energy]] before heading back to the lift, for a [[mischievous ghost]] will appear and try to shut off the valve before you can reach the lift. Run quickly around the water pipe system to the lift and go down. If the ghosts beats you, simply turn the valve again and retry. The lift remains operational after the initial activation, so the zealot's key is no longer needed. He can be pickpocketed again to obtain another key as long as the quest is not complete, though.\n\nThe lift will drop you into a pool of water. To go back up, simply click on the lift and you will automatically swim towards it. From the flooded chamber, walk south onto the track (beware of possessed pickaxes) and follow it to the east. (The western corridor leads to a locked door that you cannot open yet.) Proceed down the staircase. With the [[glowing fungus]], the cave will be properly lit. Go west through the door into a large chamber with [[loading crane]]s and [[mine cart]]s. This room is where the boss fight will take place. Do not take the [[Crystal-mine key|innocent-looking key]] until you are completely ready to begin!\n\n===Treus's wrath===\n:'''Note:''' ''Read this part fully before entering the fight if you're not experienced with the fight! Especially if you're low [[combat]]! This boss fight is difficult and should not be taken lightly. High-healing food is recommended. The surrounding environment is more dangerous than the actual [[Treus Dayth|boss]] itself.''\n[[File:Haunted Mine - Crystal-mine key.png|thumb|220px|The crystal mine key appears suspiciously easy to take.]]\n[[File:Treus Dayth chathead.png|left]]\nTo start the fight, try to pick up the [[Crystal-mine key|innocent-looking key]]. It will float away and return. Click the chatbox to continue the dialogue and the ghost of [[Treus Dayth]] (combat level 95), the erstwhile guardian of the Salve crystals, will appear and start to attack you! He will be identified on the minimap as a flashing yellow arrow. He will use his ghostly powers to move through obstacles about the room and mainly attack you with his ranged attack and possessed machinery, When chasing Treus Dayth, try to stay out of the way of the moving carts and the cranes.\n\nThe ghost itself is not that strong, but the damage from the environment can be serious. The ghost will continually become invisible and move to another part of the chamber after some hits are dealt — and the more the fight progresses, the sooner he will move, sometimes even after one hit, which is where weapons with a high maximum hit comes in handy — which makes killing this boss very difficult without [[Energy potion|energy]]/[[super energy]] potions. Whilst invisible, he cannot be attacked, but a yellow arrow indicates where he is. A large supply of food and optionally potions is advised depending on your combat level. An emergency teleport (a ring of life or the [[Ectophial]]) is very useful too.\n\nDuring the fight, carts and cranes around the room will start to operate and can cause major harm, so players should avoid them when possible. The cranes are stationary and can hit hard, but they are inaccurate and easily avoided by staying out of their reach. The carts can only move along the track they are on, similar to the other carts in the dungeon. However, these carts are dangerous because they can hit rapidly, dealing up to 9 damage every tick while dragging a player along the track. Additionally, [[pickaxe]]s will be '''constantly''' thrown at the player during the fight, hitting as much as 15 damage in one attack. [[Protect from Missiles]] is recommended for this fight, although it '''only provides 33% protection''' against the pickaxes, reducing their max hit to 10 damage. Magic attacks are very effective against the boss. Killing Treus Dayth counts towards ghost slayer tasks. A kill will grant 100 slayer xp.\n\n====Strategy====\nA highly viable strategy for low to mid-level players who can equip [[Iban's staff]] (requiring 50 [[Attack]], [[Magic]], and completion of [[Underground Pass]]) is to use [[Iban Blast]], as it hits accurately (especially against this boss) and very high. If using [[Melee]], bring the highest-hitting [[melee weapon]] you can use, such as a [[2h sword]] or [[halberd]], as this boss has a high chance to teleport somewhere else after being hit.\n\n'''Tip''': If things get heavy and too difficult, you can walk out by the door on the east and easily manage health and [[prayer]] there. The boss will not reset and still have the same amount of health as when you left the door.\n\nIt is '''not''' possible to freeze the ghost from moving using Magic or the Zamorak Godsword special attack. [[Crumble Undead]] works well against him, '''but be advised''' that a [[Skull sceptre (i)]] ('''Must be imbued''' otherwise no requirements to wield), [[Slayer's staff|Slayer Staff]] (requiring 55 Slayer + 50 Magic) or a [[Void knight mace|Void Knight Mace]] (costing 250 [[Pest Control]] points & requiring 42 Melee, Ranged, Magic, and 22 Prayer) are three of the lowest requirement weapons with which you can autocast Crumble. A [[trident of the seas]] and [[trident of the swamp]] are also good options.\n\n[[File:Haunted Mine - Fighting Treus Dayth.png|thumb|Fighting [[Treus Dayth]].]]\nAn example strategy that works quite well: bring a 4-dose [[Prayer potion]], optionally a [[Ranging potion]], and the best [[Ranged weapon]]ry you can muster, along with an inventory filled with food. Use Protect from Missiles at all times. When you reach Treus Dayth, switch on [[Eagle Eye]] to make your shots count, shoot, and then switch it off when he moves away (keep Protect from Missiles on). He likes moving between the north-western and north-eastern side of the room, in which case you are recommended to run along the northern-most cart track in the detached tunnel, where you only have to dodge one cart. If he moves south, try to hug the cavern walls to avoid the cranes as you approach him. However, don't hesitate while fighting — it's better to take a bit of extra damage and be faster than be indecisive and suffer as a result. Before fighting, you are also recommended to explore the room and practice how you are going to move around without taking too much damage — the machinery doesn't activate before the fight.\n\nUsing a [[dragon dagger]] is also a good alternative. Its [[special attack]] hits twice in one go, but this boss will only receive one of those hits before he moves away to a new spot and before you even get to him the second attack from the dagger will automatically hit him. You can keep using this tactic on the boss with minimum movement as you can use the dragon dagger's special attack numerous times during the fight.\n\nA good mid-tier magic attack that works effectively is [[Iban Blast]], or even [[Fire Bolt]] wearing [[chaos gauntlets]] on the cheap. The only downside to magic is that [[magic armour]] provides very little Ranged Defence; however, since the boss has negative magic defence, you can have a negative magic attack bonus of -35 or higher and still hit consistently. This allows for a set such as [[rune platebody]]/[[rune platelegs|platelegs]]/[[rune kiteshield|kiteshield]], [[farseer helm]], [[amulet of glory]], [[barrows gloves|Recipe for Disaster gloves]]/chaos gauntlets, and [[boots of lightness]] with Iban's staff/[[elemental staff]] to be an effective set both for damage and defence against the boss. Combined with decent food/prayer potions, you should be able to kill this boss fairly easy by just [[praying range]] and running back and forth along the northern tunnel if possible.\n\nIf you die, your items will appear on the ground until you return.{{fact}}\n\n===Salvation at last===\n[[File:Haunted Mine - Crystal mine.png|thumb|220px|The long sought-after Salve crystals.]]\nAfter defeating [[Treus Dayth]], the machinery will stop attacking you. Pick up the innocent-looking key, which no longer resists and is, in fact, the [[crystal-mine key]]. Now, head back east through the door and climb up the stairs. Walk all the way west until you reach another staircase and head down.\n\nThe crystal-mine key opens the large door to a room with several [[crystal outcrop]]s in the south-east corner. Use a [[chisel]] to cut a piece from the crystal outcrop. If you forgot your chisel, go back up the lift and pick a chisel on a crate. You will obtain a [[salve shard]] that can be crafted into a new amulet. Be sure to cut extras for backup!\n\nA nearby cart tunnel leads right back to the entrance of the mine and can henceforth be used as shortcut.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Haunted Mine\n|image = [[File:Haunted Mine reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = *{{SCP|Strength|22,000}} [[Strength]] [[experience]]\n*The ability to make the [[Salve amulet]], which when equipped gives combat bonuses against undead monsters.\n*Access to a [[Abandoned Mine#Shortcut after the quest|shortcut]] to the [[crystal outcrop]]s\n*Access to [[Tarn's Lair]]\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Haunted Mine is required for the following:\n*[[Lair of Tarn Razorlor]]\n\n==Music unlocked==\n{{MusicUnlockTableHead}}\n{{MusicUnlockLine|Spooky 2|details=Unlocked on the first level of the mine.}}\n{{MusicUnlockLine|Deep Down|details=Unlocked on the second level of the mine.}}\n{{MusicUnlockLine|Chamber|details=Unlocked on the fourth level of the mine.}}\n{{MusicUnlockLine|Haunted Mine|link=Haunted Mine (music track)|details=Unlocked on the sixth level of the mine.}}\n{{MusicUnlockTableBottom}}\n\n==Additional tips==\n*Players can use a [[ball of wool]] on a salve shard to make a [[Salve amulet]].\n*The [[crystal-mine key]] can be added to the [[steel key ring]].\n*Mining [[mithril ore]] within the [[Abandoned Mine]] is a hard task in the [[Morytania Diary]] set. You can receive a pickaxe by attempting to take one of the [[iron pickaxe]]s lying on the ground near the bottom of the lift, which will come to life (level-50) before dropping an iron pickaxe. The closest mithril ore vein is also in the south-east corner where you end the quest.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The mischievous ghost who attempts to shut the water valve and stop the lift will wail \"wooo ooo oooo\", even when wearing a [[ghostspeak amulet]].\n*You may return to the zealot to inform him of your success. He will not believe that you made it to the bottom of the mine without his key and angrily take the key back if you admit that you stole it.\n*Neither the [[Firemaking cape]] nor the [[Kandarin headgear]] work as a light sources in the deepest level of the mine. No message is given as to why they do not work.\n\n{{Haunted Mine}}"}

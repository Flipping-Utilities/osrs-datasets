Heroes from this age include [[Arrav]] and [[Camorra]], both of whom have a statue in the [[Heroes' Guild]].\n\n==Races during the 4th Age==\n===Humans===\nAside from the city of [[Saranthium]] and a few settlements in the [[Kharidian Desert]] and the refugee town of [[Burgh de Rott]] ([[Meiyerditch]], although being the city with the largest [[human]] population at that time, was ruled by [[Vampyres]]), most humans in the beginning of the Fourth Age lived in barbaric tribes. As the age progressed, they started to build new permanent settlements, some of which turned into mighty cities, thus allowing humans to become the dominant race in [[Gielinor]] by the end of the Fourth Age.\n\n===Gnomes===\n[[Gnomes]] returned to the surface right after the end of the [[God Wars]], where they found their settlements destroyed. Between the 3rd and 5th centuries of the Fourth Age, gnomes were forced to hide from barbaric human tribes, avoiding extinction. Shortly after that, the [[Grand Tree]] was planted, and gnome civilisation and technology began to thrive.\n\n===Goblins===\nFollowing [[Bandos]]' banishment from Gielinor at the end of the god wars the various goblin tribes were left leaderless. The goblins not having any commanders or \"big high war god\" to give them orders began to fight the various races, including the ogres but this led them to be driven out from the [[Feldip Hills]] in a bloody civil war. Following the goblins being driven north by the much stronger ogre tribes the Thorobshuun and Garagorshuun tribes set their eyes on on the gnomes and even though they vastly out numbered the gnomes, the gnome mage [[Glouphrie]] created illusions of giant tortoises which caused the goblins to flee in terror. \n\nFollowing the goblin tribes failures of not being able to conquer settlements of the other races and with their supplies running low they began fighting each other. The battle here lasted a long time and it seemed like the surface goblins would go extinct from the constant battle, but its at this moment a goblin gets a vision from the Big High War God which tells them to stop fighting each other and gives them their commandments as well as promising to send them a [[Zanik|Chosen Commander]] to lead them in the future. The goblin generals believe the vision and stop fighting each other and they construct a temple at the site of battle which sunk into the ground as well as writing down goblin legends and commandments in a [[Goblin Book|Holy Book]].\n\n===Ogres===\nThe ogres mostly stayed in the Feldip Hills and the only recorded historical event is their bloody civil war with the goblins.\n\n===Dwarves===\n[[Dwarves]] remained under the surface during the Fourth Age. During that time, they discovered a huge cavern where they built [[Keldagrim]]. After the city's foundation, most of their magical powers were somehow lost, allowing them to only cast [[Superheat Item]]. During the rule of [[King Alvis]], the [[Consortium]], which quickly became a ruling organisation in Keldagrim, was founded; by around the year 1650, after King Alvis's death, the Consortium ruled the entire [[Dwarven Realm]]. Due to their lack of magical abilities, the technology of dwarves had become very advanced by that time. By the end of Fourth Age or at the beginning of [[Fifth Age]], they started making first contacts with the surface once again after a few thousand years.\n\n[[Imcando dwarf|Imcando dwarves]] emerged much earlier and retained at least some contact with the surface world during Fourth Age.\n\n===Elves===\n[[Elves]] did not remain enclosed in [[Tirannwn]] during the Fourth Age. In the early Fourth Age, they ruled large areas of modern day [[Kandarin]] for at least part of the age.\n\n===TzHaar===\n[[TzHaar]], living an isolated life since the [[First Age]], made the first documented contact with the surface people.\n\n===Vampyres===\nUnder the rule of [[Lord Drakan]], the [[Vampyres]] took all of [[Morytania]] and enslaved its population. All people in what is now known as Morytania pay blood tithes to the Vampyres. Eventually, Lord Drakan felt strong enough to attack [[Misthalin]], but he was defeated and the [[River Salve]] blessed against him.\n\n==Events with known dates==\n===1st to 8th centuries===\n*1-200: The [[druid]]s, worshippers of [[Guthix]], built [[stone circle]]s to worship [[Guthix]] during this time.\n*31-60: The first star chart that is not destroyed was made in this time period, believed to have been made by the great astronomer [[Scorpius]].\n*169: 14th Ritual of Rejuvenation takes place.\n*200-500 (approx.): Human [[barbarian]]s hunted the [[gnomes]] to near-extinction, causing them to retreat to hidden settlements.\n*600-900: Permanent settlements at [[Entrana]], [[Falador]], and across [[Karamja]] are constructed.\n*659: The Kingdom of [[Great Kourend]] is founded by King Rada I.\n*669: 15th Ritual of Rejuvenation takes place.\n*700: Avarrocka, later known as [[Varrock]], was built. Varrock is the oldest surviving [[human]] settlement outside the [[Kharidian Desert]] in [[Gielinor]] today. It was founded when a tribe found a baby abandoned, and took it as a good omen. The baby eventually became [[Arrav]], a famous hero.\n*750-850: The people of Avarrocka became very powerful, and conquered their neighbouring tribes, eventually forming the first human nation, [[Misthalin]]. Misthalin, in the mid-Fourth Age, however, was little more than a rough conglomeration of tribes, all of whom paid homage to Avarrocka. Nothing that modern scholars would call a nation existed until the end of the Fourth Age.\n\n===9th to 15th centuries===\n*800-1000: The kingdom of [[Asgarnia]] was founded in this time.\n*900-1000 (approx.): The government of Avarrocka changed to a monarchy during this period, but the precise date is unknown. It may have been the creation of the Monarchy when the city was renamed Varrock, but it could also have been the start of the [[Fifth Age]] or the \"official\" founding of [[Misthalin]]. The [[dwarves]] discover that the [[God Wars]] have ended and begin to resurface.\n*1100-1200: Many dark creatures from [[Morytania]] attacked Misthalin, especially Avarrocka. Seven priestly warriors defeated them and blessed the [[River Salve]], making it impassable to creatures of [[Zamorak]].\n*1139-1239: The dark mage, [[Xeric]], firmly asserts his power over [[Great Kourend]], remaining in power for 100 years until he was deposed by an uprising led by Byrne, thereafter known as King Byrne I.\n\n===16th to 20th centuries===\n*1650 (approx.): After the death of [[King Alvis]], the consortium takes over [[Keldagrim]]. During the next few hundred years, the [[dwarves]] become very prosperous, as well as technologically advanced. The Consortium's leadership enables the development of steam powered boats and trains, as well as advancing methods of smelting [[ore]] in factories.\n*1777: Settlers came up the [[River Salve]], looking for places to settle, heedless of the warnings they received at [[Paterdomus]], and settled in [[Morytania]], building [[Canifis]], [[Port Phasmatys]], and [[Fenkenstrain's Castle]]. They all eventually came under the dominion of the [[Vampyres]]. Port Phasmatys was eventually freed, but the inhabitants were betrayed by their saviour, [[Necrovarus]], and became ghosts unable to pass on to the next life.\n*1937: The town of [[Lumbridge]] was founded in [[Misthalin]]. [[Al Kharid]] was built soon after, but its people were independent of Misthalin.\n*1969-1989: Unknown civil war breaks out in [[Great Kourend]]. King Kharedst I succeeds afterwards.\n*2000: Discovery of [[Rune Essence (rock)|Rune Essence]], leading to the dominance of humans.\n\n==Events with unknown dates==\n*Avarrocka was renamed [[Varrock]].\n*[[Mort'ton]] is affected by the haze originating from [[Castle Drakan]], turning inhabitants into [[afflicted]] and disturbing shades in their catacombs. This, according to the [[Diary of Herbi Flax]], happened when Avarrocka had been renamed Varrock.\n*The [[Zamorakian]] order of [[Black Knight]]s is established in northern [[Asgarnia]], leading to constant conflict with the [[White Knight]]s, which eventually leads to their political overthrow and exile from Asgarnia.\n{{History}}"}

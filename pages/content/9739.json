Except for special cases, any food that can be cooked on a [[fire]] can be cooked on a range. To cook food, simply 'use' it on the range. Ranges are marked on a player's [[map]] by the [[File:Cooking range icon.png]] [[icon]]. Several other objects such as [[clay oven]]s and Sulphur vents can serve the same function as a range.\n\nCooking on a range reduces the [[burn chance]] for certain foods. The range in [[Lumbridge Castle]] (referred to as the \"[[Cooking range (Lumbridge Castle)|Cook-o-matic 100]]\"), which requires completion of [[Cook's Assistant]] to use, has an even lower burn rate for certain foods. Lastly, the clay ovens in the [[Hosidius Kitchen]] give the best reduction in burn rates, providing the player has obtained 100% [[Hosidius]] [[favour]].\n\nA table of the levels where cooking food items becomes successful 100% of the time can be found [[Cooking/Burn level|here]].\n\n==Tips on leveling cooking==\nFor players training Cooking with a low Cooking level, ranges can come in handy, especially the ranges within [[chicken]] farms. A common tactic would be to collect as many [[raw chicken]]s as possible (which are commonly left behind by other players, who kill chickens to collect their [[feather]]s), and cook them in the range by selecting \"cook all\". A good place to train at low levels is in the [[Champions' Guild]]. You can easily kill chickens, cook them, then sell them upstairs.\n\nIt is highly recommended to use a Range over a Fire, as it will greatly reduce your burn rate, and thus increase your experience gained. Even better is to use the range on the ground floor of [[Lumbridge Castle]], the [[Cooking range (Lumbridge Castle)|Cook-o-matic 100]], after completion of [[Cook's Assistant]].\n\nThe best place for levelling cooking is the bank chest in the [[Myths' Guild]], which requires completion of [[Dragon Slayer II]]. The range and bank border the same tile, meaning no walking is required to cook at this location. Another area, which has lower requirements, is in the [[Cooks' Guild]]. This requires the completion of the [[Varrock Hard Diary]] in order to access the bank. The range there is right next to the bank, so the time between banking and cooking is only a tiny bit slower than at the [[Rogues' Den|Rogues' Den Fire]] in [[Burthorpe]]. The time lost is more than compensated for, however, by the reduced burn rate when cooking on a range.\n\nIf you do not have the requirements for the [[Cooks' Guild]] bank area, the second best place to level cooking is in [[Hosidius Kitchen]]. You require 100% [[Hosidius]] [[favour]] to use the clay ovens here, but there is a bank only 6 spaces away, and it also provides a 5% lower burn chance.\n\nWhen cooking certain [[fish]], you should always be wearing the [[Cooking gauntlets]], a possible reward from the [[Family Crest]] quest. These gauntlets significantly decrease the likelihood of burning [[Lobster|lobsters]], [[swordfish]], [[monkfish]], [[sharks]] and [[anglerfish]].\n\n==Range distances from a nearby bank==\n===Free-to-play===\n* 22 spaces - [[Al Kharid]] - Range north of bank.\n*24 spaces - [[Clan Hall]] - Oven south of bank.\n* 25 spaces - [[Edgeville]] - Stove west of bank — there is a gate and a door that periodically shuts.\n* 29 spaces - [[Falador]] - Range east of the east bank.\n* 22 spaces + 2 extra clicks - [[Lumbridge Castle]] - Requires completion of [[Cook's Assistant]].

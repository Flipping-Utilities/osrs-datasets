The severity of glitches can vary.\n\nIn rare cases, a major glitch might cause [[Jagex]] to do a complete shutdown of the game making all worlds offline, followed by [[banning]] the players who abused such a glitch or [[Rollback|rolling back]] the game state to a previous point.\n\n==Jagex view on glitches==\nPrior to [[24 April]] [[2018]], [[Jagex]] upheld a strict policy of no items returned that were lost from glitches; however, after the [[World 347 Glitch]], they \"restored\" items lost from the glitch with the form of [[Old school bond|bonds]] (as well as restoring [[experience]]). Untradeables were not returned.\n\nOn [[7 June]] [[2018]], Jagex stated that they previously set a precedent with the handling of the World 347 Glitch and aimed to restore players' accounts when losing items or experience to glitches if Jagex were completely to blame.{{CiteReddit|url = https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/8pbg19/just_lost_my_only_armadyl_chestplate_due_to_a_bug/e09zsw7/|title = Just lost my only armadyl chestplate due to a bug in ToB, kept this instead|date=7 June 2018|author = Mod Sween|quote=With the issue that affected Deadman we set a precedent of attempting to restore accounts to the best of our ability if any sort of loss was caused by an action within our control.}}\n\n==Rules on bug abuse==\nAbuse of glitches is a direct breach of the \"bug abuse\" rule as stated under [[Rule 4]] of the rules of ''RuneScape''. The punishment for guilty parties varies depending on the particular glitch and the degree to which it was abused. Minor graphical glitches generally go unpunished while major abuse may result in a permanent [[ban]].\n\n[[Jagex]] has recommended that players who discover glitches in ''[[RuneScape]]'' should report it to Jagex immediately either in-game or via the \"Submit a Bug Report\" option on the ''RuneScape'' website.\n\nIt should be noted that some non-gamebreaking glitches that have been deemed acceptable by the community such as prayer flicking and tick eating are not bannable.\n\n==Noteworthy glitches==\n===Entity combat glitch===\nIn 2015, it was revealed there was a major glitch involving the [[granite maul]]'s special attack in combination with trying to perform a [[logout]] during combat, known as a fake logout. If done correctly, any entity (monster and player) would be unable to attack the player, making them invincible. This also had additional side effects such as a [[Pest Control]] game involving the player who performed the exploit never actually ending. This exploit was most notably used against the [[Corporeal Beast]].\n\n===World 347 glitch===\n{{Main|World 347 glitch}}\nAfter switching servers for scheduled maintenance on [[24 April]] [[2018]], the world 347 was given [[Deadman Mode]] status without forcing players to log out first. This resulted in players losing items and stat reductions, as well as accounts with game-breaking attributes.\n\n===Theatre of Blood glitch===\nUpon release of the [[Theatre of Blood]], there was a glitch where the player holding the [[Dawnbringer]] who died would drop another item in their inventory, while the game was meant to drop the Dawnbringer.{{CiteReddit|url = https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/8pbg19/just_lost_my_only_armadyl_chestplate_due_to_a_bug/e09woi3/|title = Just lost my only armadyl chestplate due to a bug in ToB, kept this instead|author = Mod Kieren|date=7 June 2018|quote=The staff is supposed to drop instantly on death so other players can use it should you have died; if it was found in your inventory we inadvertently dropped a different slot to the one the staff was in.}} In one instance, the player was an [[Ironman Mode|ironman]] whose [[Armadyl chestplate]] was picked up by their teammate, and as they could not trade it back, Jagex offered to swap the item to its owner.{{CiteReddit|url = https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/8pbg19/just_lost_my_only_armadyl_chestplate_due_to_a_bug/e09yr04/|title = Just lost my only armadyl chestplate due to a bug in ToB, kept this instead|author = Mod Ayiza|name = Ayiza comment|date=7 June 2018|quote=We have so far had two confirmed instances of this occurring, and in one instance (this one), a player has lost an item due to no fault of their own.

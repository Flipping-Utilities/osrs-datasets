This may be a method of [[transportation]]—for example, the [[Ardougne teleport lever|Ardougne]]/[[Edgeville teleport lever]]. Players can usually pull a lever simply by left-clicking on it (see [[Game controls]]).\n\nThe \"lever\" which most players are referring to when mentioning it in game is the Ardougne teleport lever, a common way to get in and out of [[Deep Wilderness]] quickly and relatively safely. There is a similar lever located in the mausoleum just south of the [[Edgeville]] bank that also leads to the [[Deserted Keep]]. There is another lever in the Deserted Keep; pulling that one will always teleport you to [[Ardougne]].\n\nLevers are also often used in [[quests]], perhaps as a simple control on a machine, or on a wall. For example, in [[Ernest the Chicken]], players must pull five levers in a specific order to obtain the [[oil can]] needed for the quest.\n\nAlso, a lever could be found in one of the ''ScapeRune'' [[random event]]s. Players were instructed to pull a lever to find the shape of the balloon that they were supposed to pop and give the resulting key to [[Prison Pete]]. It took three successful attempts in a row for the player to complete the random event.\n\n[[Members]] may also build a lever to activate the [[trapdoor]] in the [[Throne Room]] of their [[Player-owned house]]. This can be an [[oak lever]] at level 68 [[Construction]], a [[teak lever]] at level 78 Construction, or a [[mahogany lever]] at level 88 Construction.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lever (Temple of Ikov)|Lever]], an item used in the [[Temple of Ikov]] quest.\n*[[Lever schematic]], an item that players can obtain during the [[Elemental Workshop II]] quest.\n*[[Lever (Dorgesh-kaan agility course)]], an item used in the [[Dorgesh-Kaan Agility Course]].\n*[[Ernest the Chicken]] quest, need to pull on levers A through F to obtain the [[oil can]] in [[Draynor Manor]].\n*[[King Black Dragon Lair]], a lever accessed outside surrounded by [[poison spider]]s after descending a ladder west of the [[Lava Maze]].\n[[Category:Interactive scenery]]"}

They are currently working on a Facebook game called Carnage Racing, which is now out and available on Facebook or through the Carnage Racing Website at [https://web.archive.org/web/20130406011156/http://www.carnageracing.com/ www.carnageracing.com].\n\n==Future development==\nJagex have stated on their website that they \"intend to become a significant online operator in all the major gaming markets worldwide\"{{CiteGeneral|url=http://www.jagex.com/corporate/About/history.ws |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702205535/http://www.jagex.com:80/corporate/About/history.ws|archivedate=2 July 2007|title=Jagex Company History|publisher=Jagex Ltd.}} by developing new games using their own technologies.\n\nThere had been many rumours of Jagex's next big release, and Jagex confirmed at the gaming event E3 on [[15 July]] [[2008]] that it would be releasing a new MMORPG called ''MechScape''.{{CiteGeneral|url=http://www.massively.com/2008/07/15/jagex-teases-sci-fi-successor-to-runescape-mechscape/|date=15 July 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719094125/http://www.massively.com/2008/07/15/jagex-teases-sci-fi-successor-to-runescape-mechscape/|archivedate=19 July 2008|author=Michael Zenke|title=E308: Jagex teases sci-fi successor to RuneScape, Mechscape|publisher=Massively}} ''MechScape'' game was planned to be released in the first quarter of the year of 2009, but it was delayed. It would have been a futuristic MMO that would have broken away from ''[[RuneScape]]'''s simple roots{{CiteGeneral |url=http://www.mechscapeworld.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525215516/http://www.mechscapeworld.com/|archivedate=25 May 2010|title=MechScape World|publisher=MechScape World}} but would still have been browser based. The game would have been aimed at a higher age range and would have been slightly or wholly sci-fi.{{CiteGeneral|url=http://www.zybez.net/community/index.php?showtopic=1099704|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080816021214/http://www.zybez.net/community/index.php?showtopic=1099704|archivedate=16 August 2008|title=MechScape - what do we know?|date=08 August 2008|publisher=Zybez}} However, it was cancelled in August 2009, but Jagex confirmed, on a MechScape fan forum, that they were re-developing it from scratch and had changed its name to \"Stellar Dawn\". On [[2 March]] [[2012]], Jagex announced a pause on the development of ''Stellar Dawn'', in order to focus on other larger projects such as ''Transformers Universe'' and the continually-evolving future of ''RuneScape''.\n\nJagex also acts as the publisher of the online flash-based game called \"War of Legends\". It is a multiplayer real-time strategy game.\n\n==Operation==\nJagex has grown heavily since the founding of the company in 2001. They currently have offices in Cambridge and London, with a small office in California. The company had been recruiting heavily in 2006 and has over 500 employees, grouped into the multiple departments across the three offices. In 2011, they recruited nearly 200 employees, and {{RSL|Mark Gerhard}} has stated that they have doubled the size of the ''[[RuneScape]]'' team in order to bring about the {{RSL|Evolution of Combat}}, multiple game engine upgrades, and ''{{RSL|RuneScape 3}}''.\n\nThey maintain about 140 servers for ''RuneScape'' in various locations in United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, New Zealand, Mexico and the United States. Some of the more recent additions to the servers include the addition of the German, French, and Portuguese servers. These are currently the only servers for non-English versions of the game thus far, but Jagex has confirmed that more languages are planned.{{CiteNews|url=https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/runescape-france|title=RuneScape France|newsdate=11 December 2008}}\n\n==Beyond ''RuneScape''==\nWhile most of Jagex staff work with ''[[RuneScape]]'', they have separate departments for each game they develop.\n\n===DeviousMUD===\nIn 1999, Jagex created a game called \"{{RSL|DeviousMUD}}\", now called ''[[RuneScape]]''. ''DeviousMUD'' was never opened to the public. DeviousMUD's subline was \"DeviousMUD by Andrew Gower\". {{RSL|Andrew Gower}} demonstrated ''DeviousMUD'' at {{RSL|RuneFest 2010}}.{{CiteVideo|author=jettyguy|title=RuneFest - Runescape Genesis Devious MUD|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD63B3YtYjo|date=30 August 2010|site=YouTube}}\n\n===Classic Jagex games===\n*''Vertigo'' (a new version entitled ''Vertigo 2'' was released on ''{{RSL|FunOrb}}'')\n*''Flea Circus'' (the original version has been taken off the Jagex site and has been replaced with a new version on ''FunOrb'')\n*''Tetralink'' (could be found on the ''FunOrb'' site as a newer version)\n*''Cyberwars''\n*''Warships''\n*''Checkers'' (re-formatted to [[Draughts]] in the [[Burthorpe Games Room]])\n*''Chess'''(a multiplayer version of the game could be found on ''FunOrb'')\n*''Reversi'' (re-formatted to [[Runeversi]] in the [[Burthorpe Games Room]])\n*''Go-Ma''\n*''SlimeWar'' or ''Ataxtix'' (renamed to ''Virogrid'', could be found on ''FunOrb'')\n*''Monkey Puzzle'' (renamed to ''Monkey Puzzle 2'', could be found on ''FunOrb'', although the original version can still be found on the Jagex website via link manipulation, which can be found [http://jagex.com/corporate/Minigames/monkeypuzzle.ws here])\n*''The Bottomless Pit'' was an old animation by Jagex that was listed as a game. It was a never-ending animation. It would display a series of messages, each with a delay of around five seconds at the bottom of the screen while an animation of falling into endless darkness was shown, and then, the messages would start over once they were all displayed. There was also a seamlessly looping sound of a falling noise. ''The Bottomless Pit'' is no longer available on the Jagex website. If you would watch ''The Bottomless Pit'' for long enough, you would discover that it actually tells you cheat codes for various classic Jagex games, but those who would use the cheat codes would not have their scores saved to the high scores table.\n*''Outpost 31''\n*''Goldmine''\n*''Meltdown'' (''Dr. Phlogiston Saves the Earth'' is a possible remake of this game)\n*''Meteoroids'' (''Stellar Shard'' is a possible remake of this game)\n\n===FunOrb===\nIn February 2008, Jagex announced that they would be releasing a casual browser-based gaming site called ''{{RSL|FunOrb}}'' within the month. FunOrb was released on [[27 February]] [[2008]].{{CiteGeneral|url=http://forum-fo.funorb.com/forums.ws?0,1,0,49|author=Mod Korpz|title=FunOrb Announcement Forums|date=27 February 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302172159/http://forum-fo.funorb.com/forums.ws?0,1,0,49|archivedate=2 March 2008|name=FunOrb Release Date}} It uses the same account information as ''[[RuneScape]]'', but requires a separate membership.\n\nThe site hosts small games varying in amount of possible playtime from an hour to two days. Some of the website and games are completely free-to-play, although members receive many other benefits, such as many achievements, fullscreen mode for all games, and access to more features in nearly all games. Jagex offers a discount for those who are paying members of both ''RuneScape'' and ''FunOrb''.\n\nIt was originally released with 18 games; the amount of games has increased to 43 over the time. However, since [[16 September]] [[2010]], there wasn't a single update, besides bugfixes.{{CiteGeneral|url=http://services.funorb.com/m=news/list.ws|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805203656/http://services.funorb.com/m=news/list.ws|archivedate=2018-08-05|title=FunOrb News|name=funorb}}\n\nThe most popular game on the site is ''Arcanists''. Jagex has used almost exclusively the popularity of ''RuneScape'' to gain patrons for this site, with almost all ''FunOrb'' players being either current or former ''RuneScape'' players due to very little advertising.\n\nIn January 2009, Jagex released a multiplayer game called ''{{RSL|Armies of Gielinor}}''. This is the game that is set in the ''RuneScape'' universe they promised to release. You can summon beasts such as [[Black knights]], [[Greater demon]]s, [[Aviansie]]s, and other [[monsters]] from the ''RuneScape'' universe. It was once one of the most popular games on ''FunOrb''.\n\nOn 23 January 2013, {{RSL|Mark Gerhard}} confirmed that he has plans for a full reboot and update of ''FunOrb'' in the long term. It will include a rework of the website, updates to current games, addition of new games, and creation of even more mobile games than before. Gerhard stated that the earliest they could do this would be in 2014, as 2013 is the year that they're focusing on ''{{RSL|RuneScape 3}}'' and ''Transformers Universe''.{{Fact}}\n\nOn 9 May 2018, Jagex announced they would be shutting down the FunOrb servers effective 7 August, stating \"''advancements in software and hardware have made it increasingly difficult to access and play the games on the portal, and that’s ultimately led to our decision''\".{{CiteGeneral|url=https://www.mcvuk.com/jagex-to-close-online-game-portal-funorb/|title=Jagex to close online game portal FunOrb|author=MCV Staff|date=9 May 2018|publisher=MCV/Develop}}\n\n===MechScape and Stellar Dawn===\nRumoured during parts of 2007 and throughout 2008, ''{{RSL|MechScape}}'' was an MMORPG due for release in the first quarter of 2009.{{CiteVideo|author=Schiehsl3|title=Jagex Confirms MechScape (At E3)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8Rx2GTS3RI|date=1 December 2008|site=YouTube}} However, the MechScape project has since been dropped.{{CiteGeneral|url=http://www.casualgaming.biz/news/29415/Jagex-scraps-MechScape|title=MechScape dropped by developer Jagex|author=Michael French|date=30 October 2009|publisher=casualgaming.biz|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091101202611/http://www.casualgaming.biz/news/29415/Jagex-scraps-MechScape|archivedate=1 November 2009|name=casualgaming.biz}}\n{{cquote2|Sadly the game was not as complete as we wanted and we spent the first few months trying to \"fix\" the game where we could. About a month or so ago we took the decision to stop trying to \"fix it\" as we still wouldn't have the game we wanted and the game certainly did not meet all the objectives and specifications established in the original game design document and therefore it would be better to go back to the founding principles and build the game we always wanted –Andrew is now overseeing the project and working very closely with the team to build {{RSL|Stellar Dawn}}, not all was lost as we naturally have developed the game engine substantially over the last few years and the new designs benefits massively from this as well as a ton of experience within the team as to what works and what doesn't. So whilst the content and a lot of the game play will change from what was previously built almost everything else will go straight back into Stellar Dawn.{{CiteGeneral|url=http://www.mechscapeworld.com/2009/10/25/mark-gerhards-qa-with-mechscape-world/|title=Mark Gerhard’s Q&A with MechScape World|author=PoultryChamp|date=25 October 2009|publisher=MechScape World|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027233650/http://www.mechscapeworld.com/2009/10/25/mark-gerhards-qa-with-mechscape-world/|archivedate=27 October 2009}}|{{RSL|Mark Gerhard}}, 25 October 2009}}\n\nBuilding on the MechScape game engine, Jagex planned to release a new MMO, confirmed to be ''Stellar Dawn'', in 2010.{{NamedRef|casualgaming.biz}}\n\nPreviously, if one attempted to go to [http://www.stellardawn.com/ Stellardawn.com], they would be redirected to [https://web.archive.org/web/20180806230442/http://funorb.com/ FunOrb.com].

It was in development for several years, and the game was released into Open Beta in 2014. This game has received much more mainstream coverage than any of Jagex's previous games, as it is part of a major entertainment franchise. However, the game was shut down on [[31 January]] [[2015]], after being announced that the game would be closing.\n\n===Ace of Spades===\n''Ace of Spades'' is a sandbox-style first-person shooter originally developed by former developers of ''{{wp|Minecraft}}''. The original developers decided to leave, and Jagex took over the remainder of the development. Its goal is to go against the cliches of most first-person shooters and create a unique experience. It has been in prototype phase for a year, and has already garnered more than one million players. It has been released and is available on {{wp|Steam (software)|Steam}} for a small, one-time fee.\n\n==Charity fundraising==\nSince 2004, Jagex has made donations to a number of national and international charities. It has also run charity auctions for signed merchandise.\n\nIn 2008, they donated artwork and prizes to the MMOCalendar, which raises funds for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\n\nIn 4 years (probably 2005-2008{{Fact}}), Jagex has donated money to charity, broken down as below.\n*Year ending 6 March - £106,000\n*Year ending 7 March - £157,000\n*Year ending 8 March - £147,000\n*Current year to date - £127,000\n\nThe charities that Jagex have donated to include:\n*Save the Children\n*CAFOD\n*Hamlin Churchill Childbirth Injuries Fund\n*Cancer Research\n*Cystic Fibrosis Trust\n*The University of Pennsylvania\n*Royal Marsden Cancer Campaign\n*Bury Bombers Wheelchair Basketball\n*SOS Children's Villages\n*East Anglican Children's Hospice (EACH) {{CiteGeneral|url=http://www.jagex.com/corporate/Giving_Back/charities.ws|title=Charities|author=Jagex Ltd.|date=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818193806/http://www.jagex.com/corporate/Giving_Back/charities.ws|archivedate=18 August 2011}}\n\nJagex has also taken part in the Movember charity for men, and all revenue that comes from [[RuneFest]] is donated to charity.\n\nFurther charity has been taken in the form of conversion of in-game wealth from players donations to money, from the [[Well of Goodwill]], donated at $1 per 1 million gp.\n\n==YouTube channel==\nAlso in early 2008, Jagex created their own {{wp|YouTube}} channel, called \"thejagexchannel\", which is \"The official YouTube channel for Jagex Ltd, producers of quality online games based on Java technology.\"{{CiteGeneral|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/thejagexchannel|title=Jagex|publisher=YouTube}} However, this channel is rarely used since 2013.

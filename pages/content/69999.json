The examine text implies that it is possibly a statue of Xeric himself.]]\n[[File:Xeric symbol.png|left|150px|The symbol of Xeric.]]\n'''Xeric''' was a powerful mage who ruled [[Great Kourend]] nearly 1,030 years ago. He was responsible for the [[Age of Strife]] and the creation of the [[lizardmen]], who honour him as a great king.\n\n==Personality==\nXeric is an extremely ruthless and power-hungry ruler who chooses to subjugate everyone he deems disposable regardless of how devout they are to him, stating that the weak deserve to die. He trusts very few people, but rewards them for their loyalty to him; he treats [[Xamphur]] cordially and extended a similar hand to [[Tekton]]. He does not take kindly to betrayal and other \"failures\", having punished [[Vasa Nistirio]] for his attempted coup and the [[Vanguard]] for what he perceived as cowardice.\n\n==History==\n===As King Shayzien VII===\nThe [[Arceuus]] wizard [[Ektheme]], found in the [[Library Historical Archive]], suggests that Xeric is actually King Shayzien VII.{{CiteNPC|npc=Ektheme|quote=It is often speculated that Xeric and his predecessor, King Shayzien VII, were in fact the same person.}}\n\nKing Shayzien VII took control of Great Kourend during the 32nd decade. During his reign, he was obsessed with the Dark Altar, and had spent a large majority of his time in the [[Tower of Magic]] performing experiments on citizens he summoned. Here, he oversaw the construction of various new sections, presumably to conduct magical experiments.\n\nHe was eventually killed in the Battle of the Concourse five decades later, and his body was never recovered.{{CiteNPC|npc=Ektheme|quote=The king was killed at the Battle of the Concourse during the thirty-seventh decade. We have many accounts of this yet his body was never recovered.}} A few days after the battle, Xeric appeared and was said to have had a similar appearance to Shayzien VII.{{CiteNPC|npc=Ektheme|quote=Just days after his death, we have the first recorded mention of Xeric, an incredibly powerful mage who resembled the king.}}\n\nThis battle is also documented in [[Killing of a king]], a text found in the [[Arceuus Library]], where it is written that a coup d'état was attempted by his Elder Warriors, who successfully killed him.\n\n===As Xeric===\nAfter the death of King Shayzien VII, it was speculated that he had used the power of the [[Dark Altar]] and moved his spirit from his mortal body into an incorporeal one,{{CiteNPC|npc=Ektheme|quote=...we know the Dark Altar has the power to resurrect beasts. We also know that it can extend life. It's how the people of Arceuus are immortal. King Shayzien VII may have found a way to combine these powers.}} allowing him to gain massive power and emerge victorious from the battle against the soldiers. As he reigned Great Kourend for a hundred years, it can be assumed that he had achieved immortality before [[Great Kourend#The Ascent of Arceuus|The Ascent of Arceuus]]. At this point, he began to refer to himself as Xeric.\n\n[[File:Lizardman brute.png|thumb|left|170px|A lizardman, one of many created to serve Xeric.]]\nWith his newfound power, Xeric proceeded to kill the rulers of the five cities and claimed Great Kourend as his own.{{CiteNPC|npc=Ektheme|quote=It is written that Xeric killed the rulers of Kourend's five cities and claimed the kingdom as his own.}} However, while he was very powerful, he couldn't rule the people singlehandedly, nor could he rely on human informants. His solution was the [[Lizardmen/Lore|lizardmen]], whom he had secretly created sometime during the 37th decade (''1,040 years ago'') after the alleged failure of [[The Great Expedition]] via experimentation on lizards native to Mount Quidamortem. With the lizardmen at his disposal, who were fiercely loyal and did as he commanded without question, the people were powerless to resist his authority, and thus began the Age of Strife. Many fled from Great Kourend, seeking refuge south-west of the kingdom, beyond the [[Kebos Lowlands]]. Here, the refugees founded the kingdom of [[Varlamore]].{{CiteText|text=Imafore's betrayal|quote=The Kingdom of Varlamore was formed in a very similar way to Kourend, by those fleeing the Age of Strife.}}\n\nIt is believed that the [[Tasakaal]] had granted the knowledge to immortality to Xeric for reasons unknown, and misused it; because of this, and his widespread slaughter of the people that would come after, the Tasakaal view him with contempt and become offended whenever his name is spoken to them,{{CiteNPC|npc=Tasakaal|quote=[What do you know of Xeric?] That name. It is not welcome here.}} instead calling him the \"great betrayer\".{{CiteNPC|npc=Tasakaal|quote=[What was it you called him? The great betrayer?] An apt description.}}\n\n[[File:Xerician robes equipped.png|thumb|100px|A set of [[Xerician robes]], possibly worn by loyal followers of Xeric.]]\n\nThe lizardmen served as Xeric's primary guards and enforcers. They would sweep the cities and farms, kidnapping people for use in his many experiments.{{CiteNPC|npc=Ektheme|quote=Xeric used the citizens of Kourend for many experiments, as well as for his own sadistic pleasures.}} The records of the experiments that remain imply that these experiments eventually led to the lizardman's creation.{{CiteNPC|npc=Ektheme|quote=We have little written record of the experiments, but we believe they might have led to the creation of the lizardmen.}}\n\nDuring the 40th decade, Xamphur, Xeric's closest comrade, achieved a breakthrough in the study of teleportation, giving Xeric the ability to perform a previously impossible feat. Using Xamphur's studies, this resulted in the creation of his [[Xeric's talisman|talisman]] to teleport to various places across Great Kourend in an instant.\n\nAt the height of his reign in the 43rd decade, a resistance group called HAX (Humans Against Xeric) attempted to storm the [[Tower of Magic]] and defeat Xeric, but failed, resulting in the loss of two hundred members.\n\n===Defeat and exile===\nDuring 312-47 ''(the 312th day of the 47th decade)'', Byrne, a farmer, witnessed a Lizardman guard murder a child whilst working his farm. Outraged, he slaughtered the lizardman, with the entire town as witnesses. Urging the people to fight back, the people revolted, and within seven days, the lizardmen were outnumbered and driven [[Lizardman Settlement|beyond the kingdom]] into the [[Kebos Lowlands]]. During the revolt, the temple surrounding the Dark Altar was destroyed as well, weakening Xeric's power and forcing him into exile.{{CiteNPC|npc=Ektheme|quote=During the battle, the temple surrounding the Dark Altar was destroyed, weakening Xeric's power.}}\n\n[[File:Mount Quidamortem.png|thumb|left|270px|The remains of the Xerician temple on the summit of [[Mount Quidamortem]].]]\n\nAfter his exile, Xeric no longer had the Dark Altar's power to sustain his immortality,{{CiteNPC|npc=Ektheme|quote=Without the power of the Dark Altar, Xeric would have become mortal.}} so he and the rest of his followers travelled west to [[Mount Quidamortem]], where his artisan Tekton built a massive [[Chambers of Xeric|underground complex]] for him. In addition, the unstable altar he had ordered to be built in the [[Quidamortem Cave|small cave]] within the mountain would help maintain his immortality, as it allowed the [[Dark Altar]]'s power to reach beyond where it previously could, amplifying its power.{{CiteNPC|npc=Gnosi|quote=This [unstable] altar, it seems to give off the same power as the Dark Altar... I believe this altar was created to amplify the power of the Dark Altar, allowing it to reach areas it previously couldn't.}}\n\nBased on the journals dropped in the chambers, Vasa Nistirio, Tekton, and several other unidentified members (his council, a [[creature keeper]] and many \"servants\") accompanied Xeric to the mountain.\n\nTekton's newly created temple was capable of harnessing the power of \"cave magic\" from the crystals within, which pleased Xeric;{{CiteText|text=Tekton's journal|author=Tekton|quote=Tekton built Master a new temple on mountain top. Tekton's temple could focus cave magic, bring it out of caves so anyone could use it without needing to be as clever as Tekton. Master used Tekton's temple to wield cave magic. It made Master very happy.}} however, Xeric soon became annoyed when his other followers, especially the \"nasty high priest,\" began using it,{{CiteText|text=Tekton's journal|author=Tekton|quote=But Master not so happy when everyone else started wielding cave magic too, especially nasty high priest.}} so he had Tekton demolish the temple. Tekton complied, but only disabled it, in the event that Xeric changed his mind.{{CiteText|text=Tekton's journal|author=Tekton|quote=Master told Tekton to shut down temple. Master wanted Tekton to find new ways to wield cave magic, but so only Master could do it. Tekton broke temple like Master said - but only slightly, so Tekton can fix it again if Master ever changes his mind.}} Tekton tried to teach Xeric how to use the \"cave magic\" without the temple, but failed.{{CiteText|text=Tekton's journal|author=Tekton|quote=Tekton tried to teach Master how to wield cave magic without needing temple, but Master couldn't do it. Maybe Master didn't understand crystals as well as Tekton did. Master not so happy about that.}} Xeric eventually took Tekton underground and gave him a new form{{CiteText|text=Tekton's journal|author=Tekton|quote=Master created new body for Tekton out of rock and metal from caves, and transferred Tekton's soul into it. Tekton's old body disintegrated, but that okay now Tekton was living in shiny new body that Master made.}} and enhanced his anvil, teaching him how to repair his new body.{{CiteText|text=Tekton's journal|author=Tekton|quote=Master enchanted Tekton's anvil, and brought it into cave, and taught Tekton to use it to fix the new body whenever it get damaged. Master may not understand crystals as well as Tekton, but Master still very powerful.}}\n[[File:Carving (Chambers of Xeric).png|thumb|250px|A carving found within the [[Chambers of Xeric]] beneath [[Mount Quidamortem]], which depicts a stylised representation of Xeric.]]\n\nXeric conducted extensive experiments in the chambers, which caused a dramatic change in the flora surrounding the mountain. {{CiteText|text=Stone tablet (Lizardman Temple)|quote=A strange mist surrounded the mountain this week... Was this his doing? His work on the mountain must be progressing.}} Having acquired several stray dogs, Xeric \"hired\" a hound master, as the creature keeper had died to lizardman poisoning after performing an experiment of his own. With the hound master's assistance, Xeric continued experimenting on them, eventually producing a [[Muttadile]] and a [[meat tree]] (a byproduct of the muttadile experiments);{{CiteText|text=Houndmaster's diary|quote=It had to be her though, of course it did. She was the strongest of the pack, my personal favourite, now a twisted, scaly abomination.}} unbeknownst to him, the muttadile was pregnant, and thus a second muttadile was born in the process.{{CiteText|text=Houndmaster's diary|quote=Before Master began his wretched experiments, we failed to notice her... condition. There's two of them now.}} It is unknown what happened to the other dogs and the hound master. More of Xeric's followers continued to arrive and he soon came down to visit the camp, which they took with joy. He then revealed a green tonic and ordered all in the camp to drink it, claiming that it would make them stronger and healthier. Soon after, he sent robed men to the camp; it is highly implied that all of the camp's inhabitants turned into lizardmen from drinking the tonic.\n\nWith his works still in progress, the Vanguard eventually found Xeric and re-pledged their allegiance to him.{{CiteText|text=Vanguard judgement|quote=[The Vanguard] had heard of our new settlement on Mount Quidamortem, and had come to re-pledge their allegiance to our Lord.}} Xeric treated them with respect;{{CiteText|text=Vanguard judgement|quote=...he welcomed the Vanguard, letting them approach his presence - an honour granted only to his most trusted servants. He bade us deck them in fine clothes and set out a feast in their honour, as though they were his long-lost kin rather than traitors who had failed him.}} however, this was just a ruse. He brought them down to the chambers along with a loyal follower, upon which he dropped the kind act and revealed a face of fury, using the crystals to warp the Vanguard into their current form.{{CiteText|text=Vanguard judgement|quote=Lord Xeric waved a hand in a curious gesture, and I felt a magical wave emanating from the crystals of the chamber. Writhing on the ground, the Vanguard began to melt and re-form into new shapes.}} The follower was shaken by Xeric's brutality, who revealed he had known their feelings. He then tasked them with writing a [[Vanguard judgement|book]] regarding these events.{{CiteText|text=Vanguard judgement|quote=Lord Xeric bade me record all that I had seen of the Judgement of the Vanguard. My record is to stand as a testimonial to his wrath and his vengeance. I have written it down faithfully.}}\n\nXeric and his followers eventually stumbled into a chamber where he noticed a massive rip in time and space.{{CiteText|text=Transdimensional notes|quote=In the caverns beneath Quidamortem, our lord sensed a disruption in the fabric of reality.}} He used his powers to open the rift,{{CiteText|text=Transdimensional notes|quote=Our lord managed, with much effort, to widen the disruption until a stable portal stood before us, allowing us to see out of this world and into some other realm.}} but it was too much; it was a two-way mirror where the Abyss saw Xeric and his group and vice versa.{{CiteText|text=Transdimensional notes|quote=In our awe, we looked for too long, forgetting that a door opens in two directions. We could see these creatures, and they could see us.}} A [[Vespula|massive demon-like wasp]] squeezed through the rift and overwhelmed the group,{{CiteText|text=Transdimensional notes|quote=We sought to drive it back with our magicks, but it seemed well protected from such attacks, and eventually our lord bade us retreat.}} claiming the chamber as its own. Xeric refused to accept defeat and sought a way to tame the creatures for his own purpose; as there is no mention of its success, he likely failed and eventually gave up on the prospect.\n\nHe later appointed Vasa Nistirio as his new high priest, but Vasa had gone insane after gaining a new form and demanded that Xeric worship him instead.{{CiteText|text=Nistirio's manifesto|quote=I am the god, and I need no priests. There is no need for a guide or conduit, not when my power is manifest. If Xeric will not recognise me as his lord and master, away with him!}} Despite Vasa's newfound strength, Xeric was able to defeat the treacherous high priest and bound him to the four crystals in the chamber.{{CiteText|text=Nistirio's manifesto|quote=Although the former High Priest had indeed become mighty, Xeric was able to bind him to four great crystals of power, imprisoning his avatar forever in this place.}} He then appointed another high priest to succeed Vasa.\n\nEventually, Xeric and his remaining followers encountered [[Great Olm|the Guardian in the Deep]] and defeated it,{{CiteText|text=Dark journal|quote=...our lord has led us to victory over the Guardian in the Deep, and has seized the power that he sought.}} obtaining a great amount of power in the process.{{CiteNPC|npc=Dark journal|quote=I am truly awestruck by the power that our lord now wields. If we were to return to Kourend, as he originally planned, I have no doubt that we would regain our former dominion over the kingdom with very little effort.}} The new high priest wrote a [[dark journal|journal]] documenting these events. Xeric and the others left their equipment behind in the caves, using his newfound powers to seal them in crystal. They then left for lands unknown, the new high priest believing that Xeric had greater ambitions in mind.\n\n===Return===\nXeric's activities for the next hundred years is unknown, but it is implied that he did not have a form to control and lingered about aimlessly. Xamphur, wishing to bring him back, orchestrated a series of events intended for his return, first by leading the treasure hunter [[Veos]] to him and using a proxy to allow Xeric to control him with bursts of dark energy. Xeric commended him for his ambition and that he had given up on Kourend, but told him that he had found another way to gain more power with no one able to stop them. Xeric then sensed an adventurer's presence and ordered Xamphur to dispose of them, heading to the \"far south\" for further instructions once the deed was done. Unbeknownst to either of them, the adventurer had survived.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The title the lizardmen use to refer to Xeric, ''K'uhul ajaw'', means \"{{WP|Ajaw#Meaning_as_%22lord%22|Divine lord}}\" in the pre-Columbian Mayan language.\n*Xeric's name was chosen by Mod Mat K from a list of Latin names, because it \"sounds like he should be a bad person\".{{CiteVideo|author=Shauny|title=In the Games Industry - An interview with (ex-Mod) Mat K!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX7vdMqcqsE&t=8970|timestamp=02:29:30|date=19 January 2020|site=}}\n*Previously, if the player had an activated [[ring of charos|ring of Charos]], they could attempt to charm [[Veos' Client]] during or after [[Client of Kourend]]. However, he easily foiled their attempt, asking the player if they thought that they could truly manipulate him with Charos' feeble magic. Due to the player's invaluable assistance, he willingly told them his name: Xeric. However, this dialogue was removed with the release of [[The Depths of Despair]] and [[The Queen of Thieves]] on [[9 November]] [[2017]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Rulers}}"}

Certain monsters have more than one type of 100% drops. A good example of monsters who have more than one type of 100% drops are [[metal dragons]], who drop bones and also, metal [[bars]] of the type of metal they're made of.\n\nLarge monsters (that take up more than one square) will always drop their drops in the south-westernmost square.

Untradeable drops will disappear after 180 seconds or 3 minutes after a player has dropped them.\n\n==Drop rate==\n{{Main|Drop rate}}\nAll items have a chance of being dropped that is expressible as a number—their [[drop rate]]. Drop rates are not necessarily a guarantee; an item with a drop rate of \"1 in 5\" does not equate to \"This item will be dropped after five kills.\" While each kill does nothing to increase the drop rate itself, it is trivial to state that more kills gives rise to more chance ''overall''.\n\n===Random number generator===\nThe '''{{wp|random-number generator}}''' (or '''RNG''') functions similarly to [[drop rate]]s.

Unlike the main drop, multiple tertiary drops can be obtained in a single kill; however, similarly classed items cannot be obtained at the same time; e.g., if a [[curved bone]] is obtained as a tertiary drop, it is impossible to also obtain a [[long bone]], but this roll will have no effect on obtaining a [[clue scroll]].\n\n===Rare drop table===\n{{Main|Rare drop table}}\nThe [[rare drop table]] is an extra table of drops that can be rolled if a drop slot indicating it is rolled on the main drop.

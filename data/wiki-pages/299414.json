This particular form of <i>ragging</i> can be performed by any account with at least 25 <a href=\"/w/Prayer\" title=\"Prayer\">prayer</a> level.\n</p><p>A similar form of <i>ragging</i> involves using a <a href=\"/w/Maple_shortbow\" title=\"Maple shortbow\">maple shortbow</a> in combination with a few <a href=\"/w/Adamant_arrow\" title=\"Adamant arrow\">adamant arrows</a>. They do not strictly need <a href=\"/w/Protect_Item\" title=\"Protect Item\">Protect Item</a>, but it does minimize their loses.

When being called a \"safer\" repeatedly by multiple players, consider healing less often or downgrading to a lower tier of food.\n</p><p>As a rule of thumb, in typical arranged 1-vs-1 combat both players should stay in hitpoints range where a well timed combo can knock them out, but not a single regular attack.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rushing\">Rushing</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/Free-to-play_PvP_culture?section=25&amp;veaction=edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: Rushing\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/w/Free-to-play_PvP_culture?action=edit&amp;section=25\" title=\"Edit section: Rushing\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Attacking unsuspected players in order to immediately knock them out is called <i>rushing</i>. Since typical attacks in <a href=\"/w/Free-to-play\" title=\"Free-to-play\">free-to-play</a> worlds are not powerful enough to take out entire hitpoints of fully healed players, <i>rushing</i> is often performed on players that are currently looting or fighting with someone else.\n</p><p>Accounts built with <i>rushing</i> in mind will typically have a low <a href=\"/w/Hitpoints\" title=\"Hitpoints\">hitpoints</a> level to maximize the damage output within their <a href=\"/w/Combat_level\" title=\"Combat level\">combat level</a> brackets. In particular, <a href=\"/w/Ironmen\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ironmen\">ironmen</a> accounts do not gain any combat experience in <a href=\"/w/Player-versus-player\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Player-versus-player\">player-versus-player</a> fights with the exception of basic spell casting experience.

Since the players can heal inbetween combat, members of team can take time fighting a single stronger opponent to increase their chances of a kill.\n</p><p><i>PJing</i> can also refer to <i>pile jumping</i>, a term ranging back to <a href=\"/w/RuneScape_Classic\" title=\"RuneScape Classic\">RuneScape Classic</a>. <i>Pile jumping</i> is <a href=\"#Rushing\">rushing</a> a player that is looting items from a previous kill.\n</p><p>Players that perform <i>player jacking</i> or <i>pile jumping</i> are commonly called <i>PJers</i>.\n</p><p>Note that due to the increased <a href=\"/w/PJ_timer\" title=\"PJ timer\">PJ timer</a>, <a href=\"/w/PvP_world\" title=\"PvP world\">PvP worlds</a> mostly prevent from this behaviour by locking players in combat in <a href=\"/w/Single-way_combat\" title=\"Single-way combat\">single-way combat</a> areas, and increasing the grace period after a kill.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Skull_tricking\">Skull tricking</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/Free-to-play_PvP_culture?section=27&amp;veaction=edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: Skull tricking\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/w/Free-to-play_PvP_culture?action=edit&amp;section=27\" title=\"Edit section: Skull tricking\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/w/Skull_tricking\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Skull tricking\">Skull tricking</a> is forcing unwilling players to <a href=\"/w/Skull\" title=\"Skull\">skull</a> up. Due to how inexpensive the commonly used gear is, most players already skull up when they participate in <a href=\"/w/Player-versus-player\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Player-versus-player\">player-versus-player</a> combat, so this practice is not that common on <a href=\"/w/Free-to-play\" title=\"Free-to-play\">free-to-play</a> worlds.

Due to crowding of the common PvP hotspots, <i>looters</i> can also make it more difficult to engage in combat by causing lags or even misclicks that might lead to accidental <i>skull tricking</i> of player killers that did not mean to attack them in the first place.

Serialized with PHP.\n -->\n</div>","rawContent":"This article aims to document various parts of the [[free-to-play]] [[player-versus-player]] culture, including practices and behaviours, common locations and hot spots, as well as the used slang.\n\n==Combat types==\n\n===1-vs-1 combat===\n\nArranged 1-vs-1 combat is a common form of [[player-versus-player]] activity where players participate in duels within [[single-way combat]] areas.\n\nDuring 1-vs-1 fights in typical PvP hotspots, most experienced players adhere to the following rules:\n\n* [[Protection prayers]] (or \"overheads\") are not used.\n* [[Snare]] and [[Tele Block]] spells are not used.\n* Both opponents are expected to [[Skull (status)|skull up]] or risk similar amount of money in gear or coins.\n* In general, fights are voluntary and players ask for permission before initiating duels.\n* Interrupting fights between players and attacking players that are currently looting is frowned upon.\n* Players can run away from the fights when out of food, energy, prayer points or other supplies.\n* Players keep their hitpoints relatively low, so that the opponent could take them out with a well timed combo.\n\n====Risk fighting====\n\n''Risk fighting'' is a form of 1-vs-1 combat where both player agree to risk similar amount of wealth in coins or gear. Common among experienced player killers that specialize in 1-vs-1 combat. \n\nAlthough it might be perceived as gambling akin to [[staking]], deathmatches dependant purely on luck are relatively rare, as there is no way to enforce the rules outside of the [[Duel Arena]]. Instead, most ''risk fights'' are actual duels where both players use various [[Free-to-play PvP techniques|PvP techniques]] to score the kill, not unlike in regular 1-vs-1 combat. Most ''risk fights'' follow the general assumptions of honourable 1-vs-1 combat, so techniques such as [[Snare|binding]], [[farcasting]] or using the [[protection prayers]] are not common and should be discussed beforehand. Many players will also agree upon not using combo foods such as [[anchovy pizza]] to decrease the chances of a draw. Showing the entire inventory through [[trading]] before each fight is a common practice to prove adherence to the rules and the risked wealth.\n\nIn case of uneven odds due to varying combat skill levels, players might agree upon risking coins or gear that are not equal in value. To increase the ''risk'' in such cases is commonly called ''to X someone''.\n\nDue to the increased risk in losing wealth, ''risk fights'' are not advised for the beginners.\n\n====Deathmatches====\n\nA ''deathmatch'', or ''dm'', is an arranged 1-vs-1 fight to the death were none of the players leave the combat when they run out of supplies. This might be a form of ''risk fighting'' where both players take extra loot, but this is not always the case. Some players choose not to run when out of supplies out of respect to the opponent, especially if they were nearly knocked out during the fight.\n\nBefore agreeing to a ''deathmatch'', participants should make sure that their respective opponent has similar chances for survival. For example, both players should have similar combat skills and use the same supplies to make the combat fair.\n\n===No honour combat===\n\n''No honour'' fights follow none of the unofficial rules of the arranged combat. It is basically a form of [[player-versus-player]] combat where anything goes. Techniques such as [[farcasting]], spells like [[Snare]] and [[Tele Block]], as well as [[protection prayer]]s are all allowed and commonly used to gain an advantage in combat. It includes both 1-vs-1 combat without any enforced rules, as well as teams fighting each other or chasing individual players.\n\nWhile such fights can be agreed on, these techniques are simply the norm in locations like the deep [[wilderness]] or [[PvP world]]s outside of the usual hotspots.\n\n===Multicombat===\n\n[[Multicombat]] areas allow multiple players to attack the same target. This is often leveraged by teams of player killers within locations such as the [[Chaos Temple (hut)|Chaos Temple]] or nature runes spawn south of the [[Demonic Ruins]] to quickly score the kills. Multicombat areas share some [[Free-to-play PvP techniques|PvP techniques]] with 1-vs-1 combat, but in general the overall team coordination and damage output are more important than the abilities of individual players. As such, builds that are viable in multicombat situations might slightly vary from the typical builds commonly utilized in 1-vs-1 combat, especially on the lower [[combat level]]s.\n\n====Clan wars====\n\n{{main|Clan}}\n\nThere is a [[free-to-play]] [[Clan|clanning]] community that frequently organizes wars within chosen combat level brackets. War locations include [[multicombat]] areas within the [[wilderness]] or [[PvP worlds]], as well as the [[Clan Wars]] minigame. Wars organized by clans have a much larger scale than typical multicombat fights within the wilderness that frequently occur between smaller teams of players.\n\nClans often advertise their clan chats near the common PvP hot spots such as the [[Edgeville]] bank on 308 world or [[Grand Exchange]] on the PvP world.\n\n==Locations==\n\n{{see also|Wilderness|PvP world}}\n\nThis sections lists locations that are [[player versus player]] combat hotspots. Note that activity ratings may vary over time.\n\nOn [[free-to-play]] worlds, dangerous PvP activities take place in the [[wilderness]] or the dedicated [[PvP world]]s.\n\n===[[Single-way combat|Single-way combat areas]]===\n\nThe following locations are where most of the arranged ''honourable'' 1-vs-1 fights take place.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n! Location\n! [[World]]\n! Activity\n! Points of interest\n! Comment\n|-\n! [[File:Edgeville.png|300px]]\n| [[Edgeville]]\n| align=\"center\" | 308\n| align=\"center\" | High\n| [[Wilderness]] access, [[Edgeville Monastery|Monastery]], [[Emblem Trader]]\n| Edgeville is a small town just south of the [[wilderness]]. It has a bank, [[Spawning#Edgeville|a respawn point]] and an altar in the nearby [[Edgeville Monastery|monastery]]. Low level [[Wilderness]] area north of Edgeville on [[world]] 308 remains one of the most active places to find other willing players for 1-vs-1 duels. There are no direct free-to-play teleports to Edgeville, but players can get pretty close with a [[canoe]], [[skull sceptre]] or by death with the Edgeville respawn point active.\n\nWhile less active on the PvP worlds, it is still possible to find some opponents around the Edgeville respawn area and yew trees. In contrary to the 308 world, on PvP worlds low level [[wilderness]] remains mostly unused and the fights take place around the bank. Due to the close proximity of the respawn point, this area is sometimes used for [[#Risk fighting|risk fights]], since both players can easily reset their health, run and prayer points after draws by killing each other without any items.\n|-\n! [[File:Varrock.png|300px]]\n| [[Varrock]]\n| align=\"center\" | PvP\n| align=\"center\" | Medium\n| [[Grand Exchange]]\n| Varrock is one of the biggest cities available to free-to-play players. Thanks to the nearby [[Grand Exchange]], where players can easily buy supplies, and [[Varrock Teleport]] that allows to quickly travel to the city, Varrock remains a highly active place in terms of 1-vs-1 combat. In particular, areas around the Grand Exchange, west bank and the city centre are usually active. Note that the sewers under the city and the area near [[Barbarian Village]] are [[multicombat]].\n|-\n! [[File:Lumbridge.png|300px]]\n| [[Lumbridge]]\n| align=\"center\" | PvP\n| align=\"center\" | High\n| [[Spawning#Lumbridge|Respawn point]], altar\n| Lumbridge is the first city that all players see after completing the tutorial island. It has the default [[Spawning#Lumbridge|respawn point]], a bank chest in a safe area and an altar to restore prayer points. The area in front of the castle is a pretty active place in terms of 1-vs-1 combat on the PvP world, but it tends to be used by lower level and less experienced players in comparison to Varrock—with the notable exception of [[Lumbridge#Saradomin Church|the church]], where duels of high level players take place next to the altar. Due to how close the respawn point is from the active combat area, [[#Ragging|ragging]] tends to be a problem.\n|-\n|}\n\nSince some players choose to train in PvP worlds in order to avoid crowds, other notable areas where players can be found include typical training spots with monsters such as the hill giants, flesh crawlers or ogresses. Some players can also wander throughout the wilderness, although most hotspots are in [[Multicombat area|multicombat areas]].\n\n===[[Multicombat areas]]===\n\n[[Multicombat]] areas allow groups of player killers to attack a single opponent at the same time. This is leveraged by clans to wage wars in truly many-versus-many combat, as well as by teams of player killers to score kills faster in many-versus-one combat. None of the (unofficial) rules of ''honourable'' single-way combat areas apply here, and typically players use whatever technique they can to score the kills, participating in the so-called \"''no honour''\" fights. [[Bind]] and [[Snare]] usage is common and very dangerous, as it prevents the players from escaping the multicombat boundaries.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n! Location\n! [[World]]\n! Activity\n! Points of interest\n! Comment\n|-\n! [[File:Falador.png|300px]]\n| [[Falador]]\n| align=\"center\" | PvP\n| align=\"center\" | Medium\n|\n| Falador is one of the biggest cities available to free-to-play players. Most of the city is a multicombat area, which combined with access to 2 banks and [[Falador Teleport]] for quick access leads to common activity on the PvP worlds. However, due to the ease of getting into the city, ''ragging'' tends to be a problem. To escape the multicombat area, teleport out (preferably to [[Lumbridge]]) or enter a safe zone such as one of the banks.\n|-\n! [[File:Wilderness Nature rune spawns.png|300px]]\n| Lava isle\n| align=\"center\" | Varies\n| align=\"center\" | Low\n| [[Nature runes]] spawn\n| So-called nature runes spawn is an area in the deep [[wilderness]] south-east of the [[Demonic Ruins]]. There are 2 [[nature runes]] respawns on a small lava island—the runes can be [[Telekinetic Grab|telegrabbed]] for profit. This area attracts player killers and telegrabbers alike. Especially active on [[world]] 308, it is one of the spots around which clan fights take place. To escape the multicombat area, run east.\n|-\n! [[File:Demonic Ruins.png|300px]]\n| [[Demonic Ruins]]\n| align=\"center\" | Varies\n| align=\"center\" | Low\n| [[Greater demon]]s, [[Prayer]] restoration\n| Demonic ruins is an area in the deep [[wilderness]]. Entering this place triggers passive prayer restoration. Due to the prayer restoration and close vicinity to the [[nature rune]] spawns on the south-east, this is used as regrouping spot by many clans. Some players also choose to train there on [[greater demon]]s. To escape the multicombat area, run east.\n|-\n! [[File:Bandit Camp (Wilderness).png|300px]]\n| [[Bandit Camp (Wilderness)|Bandit Camp]]\n| align=\"center\" | Varies\n| align=\"center\" | Low\n| [[Bandit Duty Free]]\n| Bandit camp is an area in the mid [[wilderness]]. Its general store buys items at their [[high alchemy]] value, which makes it profitable to sell selected items there rather than on the [[Grand Exchange]]. The shop itself is not very deep into the wilderness. However, since the entire camp is a multicombat area, it makes it much easier to kill players that try to profit here by selling items. This is one of the places where player killers can expect actual valuable loot, not just the thrill of the kill. To escape the multicombat area, run south when close to the main entrance or run east to the secondary entrance when deeper into the camp. [[Ferox Enclave]] is pretty close on the east of the camp, but keep in mind that players will not be able to enter it if [[Tele Block|teleblocked]].\n|-\n! [[File:Varrock Ditch.png|300px]]\n| [[Varrock]]\n| align=\"center\" | 308\n| align=\"center\" | Low\n|\n| The [[Wilderness]] area just north of Varrock used to be the most active multicombat area, especially in RuneScape 2. With the introduction of PvP worlds and due to restrictions on low level free-to-play accounts such as lack of the ability to join clan chats, this place lost its popularity. However, it can still be used to find some fights during peak hours. In particular, multi-combat areas north of Varrock are where wars between low level clans often take place, since low level players cannot enter the PvP worlds without a sufficient total level anymore.\n\nTo escape the multicombat area, teleport out or run south to leave the [[Wilderness]].\n|}\n\nSome less active areas include [[Dark Warriors' Fortress]], [[Chaos Temple (Wilderness)|Zamorak temple]] and hill giants north-east of the Zamorak temple.\n\n===Mixed areas===\n\nThese places mix both [[single-way combat]] and [[multicombat]] areas in close proximity. They are generally less dangerous than entirely multicombat areas for solo player killers and small teams.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n! Location\n! [[World]]\n! Activity\n! Points of interest\n! Comment\n|-\n! [[File:Ferox_Enclave.png|300px]]\n| [[Ferox Enclave]]\n| align=\"center\" | 308\n| align=\"center\" | High\n| Mid level [[Wilderness]] access, bank, [[Pool of Refreshment]]\n| [[Ferox Enclave]] is a settlement in the [[wilderness]]. It provides access to PvP minigames, a bank chest, a [[Ferox Enclave respawn|respawn point]] and two restoration options in form of free-for-all [[Clan Wars]] portal and the [[Pool of Refreshment]]—both of which restore hitpoints, prayer points, run energy and any skill changes. It is notable for being the only location with a bank within the free-to-play wilderness boundaries. It can be accessed via a waka canoe with 57 [[woodcutting]], with the minigame teleport or by dying with [[Ferox Enclave respawn|the respawn point]] unlocked.\n\nBeing in the [[wilderness]], the enclave provides quick access to a few notable locations:\n* Northern area based on [[Varrock]] centre at around 16 wilderness level.\n* Eastern area based on [[Lumbridge]], including the chapel with an altar at around 15 wilderness level. Has multi-combat areas to the east and south.\n* Southern area based on the [[Grand Exchange]] main entrance at around 12 wilderness level. South-eastern area is multi-combat.\n* Western area based on [[Camelot]] at around 14 wilderness level. Has a multi-combat area further to the west, near the [[Dark Warriors' Fortress]]. This one seems to be the most active, especially in terms of 1-vs-1 combat.\n\nThere are small safe areas around the town's gates, although they do not provide protection for players that are [[teleblocked]]. The enclave itself also cannot be entered under the effect of the [[Tele Block]] spell.\n\nWith access to the best free-to-play restoration methods and a respawn point, [[Ferox Enclave]] has the potential to be the main hub for 1-vs-1 combat. Hovewer, since the access to the city can be restricted with a Tele Block spell, this location is more dangerous than either low level wilderness north of Edgeville or typical 1-vs-1 PvP world areas, as it encourages ''no-honour'' techniques. [[#Ragging|Ragging]], [[#Rushing|rushing]] and [[#Player jacking|player jacking]] tend to be a problem, as the [[PJ timer]] is not increased like in case of the [[PvP world]]s. Clans and teams of players might use this to their advantage by interrupting fights and killing players with drained supplies. This makes it a somewhat niche area for typical 1-vs-1 duels, although still active at peak times. In particular, mid and high level players such as maxed pures and [[main]]s often fight there.\n\nAdditionally, Ferox Enclave is a common regrouping and banking spot for players and teams that hunt in the deep wilderness, as well as clans that participate in arranged wars. It also allows to access safe player-versus-player [[minigames]] such as [[Clan Wars]], [[Castle Wars]] and [[Last Man Standing]].\n|-\n! [[File:Chaos_Temple_(hut).png|300px]]\n| [[Chaos Temple (hut)]]\n| align=\"center\" | Varies\n| align=\"center\" | Low\n| Altar, [[wine of zamorak]] spawn\n| Chaos temple is an area in the deep [[wilderness]]. It has an altar that can be used to restore prayer points and a respawning [[wine of zamorak]] that can be [[Telekinetic Grab|telegrabbed]] for profit. The temple itself and a small area around it are multicombat, but the surrounding areas to the north, east and south only allow for single-way combat. It is notable for being one of the spots where player killers can successfully score kills both alone and in a clan, as escaping multicombat area is relatively simple. Especially active on [[world]] 308, this is a place where clan fights often take place. To escape the multicombat area, run a few tiles east, south or north of the temple. When chased, keep in mind that [[The Forgotten Cemetery]] has aggressive monsters such as ankous that can attack the opponents and ease the escape.\n|-\n! [[File:Lava Maze Rune Mine.png|300px]]\n| [[Lava Maze]] Runite Mine\n| align=\"center\" | Varies\n| align=\"center\" | Medium\n| [[Runite rock]]s\n| [[Lava Maze]] is an area in the deep [[wilderness]]. There is a small mine north of Lava Maze with the only runite rocks within the free-to-play boundaries. The area around the rocks only allows for single-way combat, but the zones on both the east and the west of the rocks are multicombat. This makes it relatively difficult to escape this place. Despite this, runite mine constantly attracts both miners and player killers alike as [[runite ore]]s can be a great source of income. To escape the area, run west. When chased, [[Frozen Waste Plateau]] and [[The Forgotten Cemetery]] both have aggressive monsters that can attack the opponents. Besides, there are aggressive spiders to the west that can be lured into single-way combat area close to the mine and ''boxed'' to stall the opponents.\n|-\n|}\n\n===Comparison of locations for 1-vs-1 combat===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n! Location\n! Pros\n! Cons\n|-\n! [[File:Edgeville.png|300px]]\n| [[World|W308]] [[Edgeville]]\n|\n* Has a [[Edgeville respawn|respawn point]].\n* [[#New accounts restrictions|New account restrictions]] do not have to be met to enter the area.\n* Low level [[wilderness]] ensures that opponents must have similar [[combat level]]s in order to fight.\n* Ease of escape from combat when low on supplies.\n* [[Edgeville Monastery]] allows to restore and boost prayer points for players with at least 31 [[prayer]] level.\n* Common among low [[combat level]] pures.\n* [[Emblem Trader]] allows to apply [[skull status]] before the fights, which is especially useful for players engaging in multiple duels with each other in a row.\n* [[PJ timer]] is increased and players are locked in combat, mostly preventing from rushing and fight interruptions.\n* Has a [[Loot Chest]] in the [[Edgeville]] bank.\n|\n* The [[bank]] and [[altar]] are relatively far from the combat zone.\n* Players with a larger [[combat level]] difference need to venture further into the [[wilderness]] to be able to fight. Players are generally less eager to fight outside of their immediate combat level range.\n* [[#Looting|Looters]] can be pretty common.\n* [[Edgeville]] has no direct [[free-to-play]] teleporation methods, making it difficult to get back to for players without the [[Edgeville respawn]] unlocked.\n* Players below 31 [[prayer]] level might find it difficult to restore prayer points, as they cannot enter the [[Edgeville Monastery|{{FloorNumber|uk=1}} of the Monastery]].\n* [[Aggressive]] [[Skeleton#Level 22|skeletons]] can be a cause of misclicks and might attack players between fights.\n* Active [[server]] location limited to UK.\n|-\n! [[File:Ferox_Enclave.png|300px]]\n| [[World|W308]] [[Ferox Enclave]]\n|\n* Has a [[Ferox Enclave respawn|respawn point]].\n* [[#New accounts restrictions|New account restrictions]] do not have to be met to enter the area.\n* Medium level [[wilderness]] gives more flexibility in terms of the [[combat level]]s of the opponents.\n* Free-for-all [[Clan Wars]] portal and [[Pool of Refreshment]] allow to quickly restore [[hitpoints]], [[run energy]] and [[prayer point]]s between fights for free.\n* [[#Looting|Looters]] are rare.\n* [[Clan Wars]] free-for-all area within [[Ferox Enclave]] is usually active, and allows to engage in fights without risking any items.\n* [[PJ timer]] is increased and players are locked in combat, mostly preventing from rushing and fight interruptions.\n* Has a [[Loot Chest]] in the centre of the enclave.\n|\n* [[Tele Block]] usage and ''no honour'' techniques are encouraged due to the [[Ferox Enclave]] mechanics. It might be difficult to escape combat when low on supplies, or even to secure the entire loot after a kill without the [[loot key]]s unlocked.\n* Medium level [[wilderness]] allows players to attack opponents well below their combat level.\n* Due to close proximity of [[multicombat]] zones, inexperienced players might be [[#Luring|lured]] into areas where they can be attacked by multiple opponents at once.\n* [[#Ragging|Raggers]] tend to be a problem.\n* Active [[server]] location limited to UK.\n|-\n! [[File:Grand Exchange.png|300px]]\n| [[PvP world]] [[Varrock]]\n|\n* Access to the [[Grand Exchange]].\n* Increased [[PJ timer]] prevents from interrupting fights and eases banking loot after a kill.\n* By default, players on [[PvP world]]s can attack opponents up to 15 [[combat level]]s above or below their own outside of the [[wilderness]]. This gives flexibility in terms of the [[combat level]]s of the opponents.\n* Since players are locked in combat when starting a fight in a [[single-way combat]] area on a [[PvP world]], it is easy to avoid [[#Ragging|raggers]] by engaging in combat with another opponent.\n* As the combat hotspots are somewhat far from the [[respawn]] points and require a teleport, [[#1-itemming|1-itemming]] tends not to be a problem.\n* Due to close proximity of the safe zones with [[bank]]s to the [[PvP]] hotspots, it is possible to gather the entire loot including supplies even without the [[loot key]]s before it shows up for other players.\n* Large spaces for duels around west bank.\n* Has a [[Loot Chest]] north of the [[Grand Exchange]] bank.\n|\n* [[#New accounts restrictions|New account restrictions]] have to be met in order to enter the [[PvP world]]s, making the location uncommon among low [[combat level]] players.\n* Does not have a [[respawn]] point. [[Varrock Teleport]] is necessary to quickly travel to the town.\n* The closest [[altar]] in the [[Varrock Palace]] is rather far from the usual hot spots near [[Grand Exchange]] and the west bank. Some players choose to [[Lumbridge Teleport|teleport to Lumbridge]], use the altar in the [[Lumbridge Church]], and [[Varrock Teleport|teleport back to Varrock]] instead.\n* [[Stray dog]]s following the players might be a source of misclicks.\n* Since player attack option is not hidden in safe zones, activities such as banking are prone to misclicks in crowded areas.\n* [[PvP world]]s allow the players to attack opponents well below their combat level.\n|-\n! [[File:Lumbridge.png|300px]]\n| [[PvP world]] [[Lumbridge]]\n|\n* Has a [[Lumbridge respawn|respawn point]].\n* Increased [[PJ timer]] prevents from interrupting fights and eases banking loot after a kill.\n* By default, players on [[PvP world]]s can attack opponents up to 15 [[combat level]]s above or below their own outside of the [[wilderness]]. This gives flexibility in terms of the [[combat level]]s of the opponents.\n* Since players are locked in combat when starting a fight in a [[single-way combat]] area on a [[PvP world]], it is easy to avoid [[#Ragging|raggers]] by engaging in combat with another opponent.\n* An [[altar]] in the [[Lumbridge Church]] is very close to the combat hotspots. In fact, high level players often engage in combat inside the Church.\n* Due to close proximity of the safe zone with a [[bank]], it is possible to gather the entire loot including supplies before it shows up for other players.\n|\n* [[#New accounts restrictions|New account restrictions]] have to be met in order to enter the [[PvP world]]s, making the location uncommon among low [[combat level]] players.\n* Due to close proximity to the default [[Lumbridge respawn]] point, [[#1-itemming|1-itemmers]] and [[#Looting|looters]] might be a problem.\n* Misclicking on the [[signpost]] shows a UI overlay and captures the camera even from afar.\n* Tight spaces around the [[Lumbridge Castle]] might hinder movement, especially when crowded.\n* Numerous wandering [[NPC]]s such as [[Gee]] or [[Donie]] might be a source of misclicks.\n* Since player attack option is not hidden in safe zones, activities such as banking are prone to misclicks in crowded areas. This is especially relevant for the bank chest in front of the [[Lumbridge Castle]].\n* [[PvP world]]s allow the players to attack opponents well below their combat level.\n* Does not have a [[Loot Chest]].\n|}\n\n===PvP worlds===\n\n{{main|PvP world}}\n\nDue to the [[#New accounts restrictions|restrictions on new free-to-play accounts]], PvP worlds cannot be accessed by most low level accounts. These worlds are especially popular among players with mid and high combat levels that engage in 1-vs-1 combat, as the extra mechanics such as the increased [[PJ timer]] in [[single-way combat]] areas complement the unofficial rules of the 1-vs-1 scene very well.\n\n==Minigames==\n\n{{main|Minigames}}\n\n[[Minigames#Player versus player/monster|Combat minigames]] are a form of safe [[player-versus-player]] activities that are common among both casual players as well as player killers.\n\n===Last Man Standing minigame===\n\n{{main|Last Man Standing}}\n\n[[Last Man Standing]] is a safe player-versus-player battle royale style minigame. Its notable free-to-play rewards included the [[swift blade]] and [[adamant arrow]]s packs. While it was active within the designated [[free-to-play]] worlds, [[Last Man Standing]] features [[members]]-only combat mechanics and does not resemble the free-to-play combat very well. The competitive mode necessary to gain points to buy the rewards is now disabled within free-to-play worlds.\n\n===Castle Wars minigame===\n\n{{main|Castle Wars}}\n\n[[Castle Wars]] is a safe player-versus-player minigame with capture-the-flag mechanics. Its notable free-to-play rewards include the [[Decorative boots (gold)|gold decorative boots]] with a unique strength bonus. While somewhat active on the designated [[free-to-play]] world, combat skills are not rescaled when entering the game. This leads to a significant advantage for [[Main account|mains]] over common [[Free-to-play combat pure guide|combat pures]].\n\nDue to high damage boosts granted by [[castlewars brew]] and [[castle wars bracelet]], this minigame is often used for training with [[alt|alternative accounts]].\n\n===Clan Wars minigame===\n\n{{main|Clan Wars}}\n\n[[Clan Wars]] is a safe player-versus-player minigame. It allows for both typical fights within the free-for-all area, as well as arranged clan-versus-clan fights with specific rules. Casual fights between players in the free-for-all area are very common on the 308 world.\n\nDue to the safe nature of the minigame and the fact that arrows automatically return to the inventory upon exit, the free-for-all area of this minigame is often used for training with [[alt|alternative accounts]].\n\n===Duel Arena===\n\n{{main|Duel Arena}}\n\n[[Duel Arena]] is a minigame that allows to stake [[coins]] in arranged duels restricted by a chosen set of rules. A tax is deduced from the winnings based on the number of staked coins. The Arena is rarely used by [[free-to-play]] players, as untaxed [[#Risk fighting|risk fights]] on [[PvP world]]s or low level [[wilderness]] are a much more common alternative.\n\n===Minigames summary===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"150\" | Minigame\n!

Some of the listed practices are bannable offences.\n\n===Ragging===\n\nAttacking unwilling players in 1-vs-1 combat areas without a possibility of a fair fight is called ''ragging''. Player commonly referred to as ''raggers'' are often using defensive gear such as [[rune armour]] along with a high [[defence]] level, or use the [[Protect Item]] prayer along with a single weapon such as the [[rune scimitar]]. The goal of ''ragging'' is often not to kill the opponent, but waste their time and supplies.\n\n====1-itemming====\n\nUsing a single protected item with no supplies and consistently attacking players after respawn is called ''1-itemming''. ''1-itemmers'' usually use a [[rune scimitar]] in combination with [[Protect Item]] for its high damage output. This particular form of ''ragging'' can be performed by any account with at least 25 [[prayer]] level.\n\nA similar form of ''ragging'' involves using a [[maple shortbow]] in combination with a few [[adamant arrow]]s. They do not strictly need [[Protect Item]], but it does minimize their loses. With more range, faster attacks and considerable damage output, these ''raggers'' are similarly effective. However, in contrary to ''1-itemmers'' with a [[rune scimitar]], they do lose some supplies on every death.\n\n====Perming====\n\n''Perming'' is a form of harassment that involves constant attacking of a player by a ''ragger'' or a group of ''raggers''. The player is in effect \"permanently banned\" from entering a certain area, hence the name. Note that this can be [[Code of Conduct|reported]] under disruptive behaviour.\n\n===Safing===\n\nHealing too much in 1-vs-1 combat is called ''safing''. Keeping the hitpoints too high forces a draw, as none of the players are able to score a kill. When being called a \"safer\" repeatedly by multiple players, consider healing less often or downgrading to a lower tier of food.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, in typical arranged 1-vs-1 combat both players should stay in hitpoints range where a well timed combo can knock them out, but not a single regular attack.\n\n===Rushing===\n\nAttacking unsuspected players in order to immediately knock them out is called ''rushing''. Since typical attacks in [[free-to-play]] worlds are not powerful enough to take out entire hitpoints of fully healed players, ''rushing'' is often performed on players that are currently looting or fighting with someone else.\n\nAccounts built with ''rushing'' in mind will typically have a low [[hitpoints]] level to maximize the damage output within their [[combat level]] brackets. In particular, [[ironmen]] accounts do not gain any combat experience in [[player-versus-player]] fights with the exception of basic spell casting experience. This allows them to build combat pures with very low hitpoints levels for a specific combat level bracket that never level up through combat with other players.\n\n===Player jacking===\n\n{{main|PJing}}\n\n''Player jacking'' is an interruption of a fight between two players within a [[single-way combat]] area. In typical 1-vs-1 combat, it is often paired with ''rushing''.\n\nWithin the deep [[wilderness]], ''player jacking'' might be performed as a deliberate strategy by teams to protect their teammates and maximize the damage output on a single opponent. Since the players can heal inbetween combat, members of team can take time fighting a single stronger opponent to increase their chances of a kill.\n\n''PJing'' can also refer to ''pile jumping'', a term ranging back to [[RuneScape Classic]]. ''Pile jumping'' is [[#Rushing|rushing]] a player that is looting items from a previous kill.\n\nPlayers that perform ''player jacking'' or ''pile jumping'' are commonly called ''PJers''.\n\nNote that due to the increased [[PJ timer]], [[PvP world]]s mostly prevent from this behaviour by locking players in combat in [[single-way combat]] areas, and increasing the grace period after a kill.\n\n===Skull tricking===\n\n[[Skull tricking]] is forcing unwilling players to [[skull]] up. Due to how inexpensive the commonly used gear is, most players already skull up when they participate in [[player-versus-player]] combat, so this practice is not that common on [[free-to-play]] worlds. However, it might still be used against players that wear [[Free-to-play cosmetic items|expensive cosmetic items]] or [[PvM|PvMers]] training in armours such as [[Rune armour|full rune]] within the [[PvP worlds]] or the [[wilderness]].\n\nThere are various techniques that fall under this category. Examples of this practice include logging in under a looting player, or changing between two accounts with a very similar name, so that the opponent thinks they are fighting with a single person. It should be noted that the ''PK Skull Prevention'' option in the [[Settings#Controls|Controls Settings]] mostly eliminated these techniques, although many players that mainly participate in PvP combat do not use that setting.\n\n===Luring===\n\nTricking the players into entering dangerous zones is called ''luring''. The most common form of luring involves bringing players into [[multicombat]] zones, where they can be attacked by entire teams of players at once.\n\n===Flaming===\n\nUsing vulgar, insulting or offensive slang during or after combat is referred to as ''flaming''. It is generally frowned upon, especially in the clanning community. Severe flaming can be [[Report abuse|reported]] under ''seriously offensive language''.\n\n===Looting===\n\n''Looters'' pick up items dropped by killed players without participating in actual player-versus-player combat. While not strictly against the rules, ''looting'' makes it more difficult for legitimate player killers to pick up the entire loot from their kills. Due to crowding of the common PvP hotspots, ''looters'' can also make it more difficult to engage in combat by causing lags or even misclicks that might lead to accidental ''skull tricking'' of player killers that did not mean to attack them in the first place. Additionally, looting is a commonly [[Bot|botted]] activity, further increasing the tension between player killers and looters.\n\n===Boosting===\n\n''Boosting'' is performed by repeatedly killing [[Alt|alternative accounts]] or friends to increase the K/D ratio. This might also include focusing on players that are considered easy targets such as [[bot]]s, [[skiller]]s, ''raggers'' (''1-itemmers'') or other players that do not aim to engage in legitimate PvP combat. Boosting of the K/D ratio has no mechanical benefits in game.\n\n====Boosting in minigames====\n\nBoosting can also be performed in PvP minigames, which might be against the rules for playing multiple accounts.\n\nUsing [[Alt|alternative accounts]] in [[Clan Wars]] and [[Castle Wars]] is common for training combat skills, as both of these minigames provide convenient forms of training that allow to achieve better experience rates than typical methods involving [[PvM]] combat. Additionally, playing [[Castle Wars]] matches against alts or friends that do not legitimately participate in the minigame is a common form of obtaining [[castle wars ticket]]s necessary to buy some useful [[free-to-play]] and [[members]] items, with [[Decorative boots (gold)|gold decorative boots]] being a notable example.\n\nPlaying against [[bot]]s in the [[Last Man Standing]] minigame was a common occurrence that allowed to boost both the rewarded points as well as the win count.\n\n===Protecting===\n\nIn arranged 1-vs-1 combat, the players are expected not to use the [[protection prayers]], unless explicitly agreed upon.\n\nUsing [[Protect Item]] to avoid losing the most expensive item is also frowned upon in 1-vs-1 fights, and will usually be called out by other players, resulting in difficulties finding opponents for duels. In arranged 1-vs-1 combat, the players are expected to carry similar amount of ''risk'', meaning items or [[coins]] of similar value that are lost upon death.\n\n===Cheating===\n\nSome players choose third party clients that give them an advantage in combat or automate certain tasks such as [[prayer flicking]]. Note that this is a bannable offence.\n\n==New accounts restrictions==\n\nBrand-new [[free-to-play]] accounts have multiple restrictions that greatly affect the low level player-versus-player scene. \n\n===[[Clan Chat]] restrictions===\n\nAfter an [[Update:Clan Chat Restrictions|update]] on [[14 May]] [[2018]], [[free-to-play]] accounts require a total level of at least 150 to join a [[Clan Chat]]. This impacts the ability to from ultra low level clans, as at the lowest combat levels players were often using ''throwaway'' alternative accounts with barely any skill levels to engage in PvP activities, preventing them from joining any clans.\n\n===Trading restrictions===\n\nWith an [[Update:Easter_Event|update]] on [[2 April]] [[2020]], new [[free-to-play]] accounts were restricted even further in terms of trading. Items dropped by a brand-new account cannot be picked up by other players, although brand-new players can still pick up items dropped by others. Brand-new players may receive items in a trade, but cannot give items away. Also, they cannot create ''Sell'' offers for commonly botted items on the [[Grand Exchange]], add items to the chest in the [[Falador Party Room]] or stake in the [[Duel Arena]].\n\nMore importantly, brand-new players cannot log into [[PvP world]]s. If a brand-new player is PK’d, the opponent will still receive most of their tradable items—the exception is noted items, which are capped at 20 notes per item.\n\nThese restrictions on new accounts can be removed by buying membership, or logging over 20 hours of game time, earning 10 quest points, '''and''' reaching a total level of 100. As can be expected, this update made it even more difficult to form ultra low level clans or even individual accounts, as now idling, questing, and skilling became a necessity to unlock unrestricted trading.\n\n==Slang dictionary==\n\n{{main|Slang dictionary}}\n{{see also|PvP terminology}}\n\n===Techniques===\n\n{{main|Free-to-play PvP techniques}}\n\nRefer to the [[Free-to-play PvP techniques|PvP techniques article]] for a full explanation of each technique commonly used in [[free-to-play]] PvP combat.\n\n===Practices===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

A ''safer'' is a player who ''safes''—eats too often and too much, not giving either player an opportunity for a win. When called a ''safer'' repeatedly by multiple players, consider eating less food or—if at low [[combat level]]—switching to a worse tier of food.\n| rowspan=\"3\" | \n* ''Stop safing!''\n\n\n* ''Careful, he's a safer''\n|-\n| ''safing''\n|-\n| ''safer''\n|-\n| ''to risk''\n| rowspan=\"2\" | \n| rowspan=\"2\" | The opposite of ''safing'': keeping the hitpoints low enough to be easily taken down by a regular attack.

Whoever wins, gets the ''risked'' items. In this context, ''risk'' is the total value of the items that is lost after death. ''Risk fighting'' is a popular way of making money, as killing regular players \"with no ''risk''\" is usually not very profitable, especially compared to some available money making methods.\n|\n* ''Risk me''\n* ''Ok, 5m?''\n|-\n| ''to x (someone)''\n|\n| During ''risk fighting'', players might agree to ''risk'' unequal amount of wealth if they feel that otherwise the fight is unfair due to factors such as the [[combat level]] or overall PvP experience. To ''x'' someone is to take a higher amount of ''risk''.\n|\n* ''I'm only 60 cb, x me''\n|- \n| ''to rag''\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n| rowspan=\"3\" | Purposely preventing players from engaging in legitimate combat by constantly attacking them when they enter unsafe areas is called ''ragging''. There are usually two main forms of ''ragging'': using a reliable weapon such as the [[rune scimitar]] along with the [[Protect Item]] prayer to prevent from losing any items upon death, or using a high [[defence]] level tank account along with high tier armour and food, which realistically gives the opponents no chance to kill the ''ragger'' within their respective level range. Note that this is considered harassment and can be reported.\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n* ''I can't get any fights, I keep getting ragged\n|-\n| ''ragging''\n|-\n| ''ragger''\n|-\n| ''1-itemming''\n|\n| A form of ragging involving usage of a single item to deal consistent damage (usually a [[rune scimitar]]) along with the [[Protect Item]] prayer. Thanks to the protection prayer, ''1-itemmers'' do not risk losing any items upon death.\n|\n* ''You won't get anything, he's 1-itemming''\n|-\n| ''to perm''\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Permanent ban\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Some individuals and clans use their ''ragging'' accounts to constantly harass other players, effectively preventing them from having genuine fights. ''Permed'' players are targets of this harassment, as they are \"permanently banned\" from PvP combat.\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n* ''Stop ragging or you're permed''\n|-\n| ''permed''\n|-\n| ''avoid''\n| To avoid combat\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Used to call out players that repeatedly refuse to engage in combat and stay in safe zones. Typically used by players harassing another person or trying to set up a ''risk fight''.  \n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n* ''Avoider''\n* ''No means no''\n|-\n| ''avoider''\n| A person that avoids combat\n|-\n| ''to rush''\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Attacking players without consent, usually starting the fight with a high damage combo. Since on higher levels players are usually unable to kill the others with a single combo unless they were already damaged, free-to-play rushing is often performed on players that have just finished a fight to take advantage of their low hitpoints (''pjing'').\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n* ''That pjer rushed me after a kill''\n|-\n| ''rushing''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | ''pj''\n| Player jacking\n| Interrupting a fight in [[single-way combat]] areas, e.g. during a time when one of the players has to pause to heal. Considered a bad practice.\n|\n* ''I want to kill him, but he keeps getting pjed''\n|-\n| Pile jumping\n| A term dating back to the [[RuneScape Classic]], ''pile jumping'' is the act of attacking a player that has just finished a fight to steal their loot. Considered a bad practice.\n|\n* ''I got pjed just after the fight''\n|-\n| ''nh''\n| No honour\n| Describes a combat style where any technique goes—for example, players can ''rush'', ''safe'' or use overhead prayers, as long as it gets them the kill. Common in the deep wilderness and in the areas far from the usual hotspots in the PvP worlds.\n|\n* ''Turn off your pray, this isn't nh''\n|-\n| ''no arm''\n| No armour\n| Used when asking players with a high [[defence]] level to take their armour off to make the fight more balanced or risky.\n|\n* ''No arm?''\n* ''OK, let me bank rune then''\n|-\n| ''overheads''\n| Overhead prayers\n| [[Protection prayers]].

''To tb'' is to cast the [[Tele Block]] spell on a player.\n|\n* ''Someone tb that guy''\n|-\n| ''lure''\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Tricking a player to enter an unsafe area. There are multiple types of ''lures'', some of which can include dropping items in unsafe areas, or provoking a player to enter a more dangerous [[multicombat]] area. A ''lure'' can also be a player that performs ''luring'', e.g. by wearing expensive items and dragging an unsuspecting player to dangerous areas.\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n* ''That guy wearing gilded is such an obvious lure''\n|-\n| ''luring''\n|-\n| ''dm''\n| Deathmatch\n| A fight where none of the players leave or teleport after they run out of food.\n|\n* ''Wanna dm?''\n* ''Sure, we're almost out anyway''\n|-\n| ''to farcast''\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Farcasting]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Using an attack outside of the range of the opponent to avoid getting damaged.

In this context, [[#Looting|looting]] is the act of picking up loot left by other players.

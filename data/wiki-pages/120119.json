Although most of the journal is illegible, he managed to find an extract stating \"<i>Quidamortem's creatures are compatible. The experimentation is proving successful and we will soon be ready to mass produce.</i>\"\n</p><p>The extract had a date in the 37th decade, and yet the expedition was declared a failure a decade before, leading Phileas to question why the king wrote about Quidamortem a decade after the failure of the expedition. He will ask the player to discover the truth about his ancestor's expedition by visiting the <a href=\"/w/Library_Historical_Archive\" title=\"Library Historical Archive\">Library Historical Archive</a>. Here, the player discovers evidence that the journal may be genuine, and is prompted by Phileas to perform the expedition once more. The player is granted permission to go on the expedition by <a href=\"/w/Lord_Shiro_Shayzien\" title=\"Lord Shiro Shayzien\">Lord Shiro Shayzien</a>, who asks that any discoveries made be brought to him first, as King Shayzien VII was his ancestor and he wants to be made aware of any discoveries that may present him in a bad light.\n</p><p>Upon arriving at the summit of the mountain, an expedition from the <a href=\"/w/Varrock_Museum\" title=\"Varrock Museum\">Varrock Museum</a> reveals that they have uncovered a <a href=\"/w/Quidamortem_Cave\" title=\"Quidamortem Cave\">small cave</a>. The player discovers a temple with an unstable altar, and brings the Museum expedition to investigate. The cave is revealed to have predated <a href=\"/w/Xeric\" title=\"Xeric\">Xeric</a>, and he may have used this altar to extend his lifespan during his exile, suggesting that he may still be alive.\n</p><p>Upon returning to Lord Shiro Shayzien, he asks for proof of the player's discoveries, and prompts the player to visit Phileas for the journal. However, players discover that his tent has been trashed and he himself has gone missing. Shiro will then open an investigation into his disappearance. Without the parcel, no concrete evidence can be linked to King Shayzien VII and the player's discoveries, but he will contact the research team and ensure they are documented.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Forsaken_Tower\">The Forsaken Tower</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/Great_Kourend_quest_series?section=7&amp;veaction=edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: The Forsaken Tower\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/w/Great_Kourend_quest_series?action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: The Forsaken Tower\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/w/The_Forsaken_Tower\" title=\"The Forsaken Tower\">The Forsaken Tower</a></div>\n<p><a href=\"/w/Undor\" title=\"Undor\">Undor</a> has discovered the cause of the failure of the <a href=\"/w/Doors_of_Dinh\" title=\"Doors of Dinh\">Doors of Dinh</a>, and sends a report to <a href=\"/w/Councillor_Unkar\" title=\"Councillor Unkar\">Councillor Unkar</a>, a member of the <a href=\"/w/Kourend_Council\" title=\"Kourend Council\">Kourend Council</a>, to request for assistance. The Doors of Dinh were created by the master blacksmith Dinh to imprison the <a href=\"/w/Wintertodt\" title=\"Wintertodt\">Wintertodt</a>, an unknown entity which brings with it extremely freezing temperatures. The Wintertodt had previously ravaged Great Kourend 1,400 years ago, and it was only with Dinh and the Order of the Sacred Flame's help that the Wintertodt was sealed in its prison. With the doors failing, there is no telling what havoc the Wintertodt can wreak if it breaks free.\n</p><p>The player meets with Unkar at the <a href=\"/w/Wintertodt_Camp\" title=\"Wintertodt Camp\">Wintertodt Camp</a>, where he will explain that the Doors have been purposely damaged by someone or something, creating a small hole in the doors. Although not much, it is enough for the <a href=\"/w/Wintertodt\" title=\"Wintertodt\">Wintertodt</a> imprisoned within to draw a small amount of power into the prison. He can repair the damage, but he requires <a href=\"/w/Dinh%27s_hammer\" title=\"Dinh&#39;s hammer\">Dinh's hammer</a>, located in <a href=\"/w/The_Forsaken_Tower_(location)\" title=\"The Forsaken Tower (location)\">The Forsaken Tower</a>.\n</p><p>The player travels to the Forsaken Tower to find Dinh's hammer, which is being safeguarded by multiple puzzles.

Despite the player's efforts, the Wintertodt manages to obtain a significant amount of power and now it is up to the Order's <a href=\"/w/Pyromancer\" title=\"Pyromancer\">pyromancers</a> to subdue it.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Ascent_of_Arceuus\">The Ascent of Arceuus</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/Great_Kourend_quest_series?section=8&amp;veaction=edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: The Ascent of Arceuus\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/w/Great_Kourend_quest_series?action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: The Ascent of Arceuus\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/w/The_Ascent_of_Arceuus\" title=\"The Ascent of Arceuus\">The Ascent of Arceuus</a></div>\n<p><a href=\"/w/Mori\" title=\"Mori\">Mori</a> is walking to the <a href=\"/w/Arceuus_Library\" title=\"Arceuus Library\">Arceuus Library</a> with her friend <a href=\"/w/Thana\" title=\"Thana\">Thana</a> when they felt a strange power flow through them. Suddenly, Thana inexplicably dies without warning. Since the Ascent of Arceuus, an event over a thousand years ago which allowed all of Arceuus to become immortal, no member has died of natural causes. Mori catches the player passing by and tells them to inform the <a href=\"/w/Kourend_Council\" title=\"Kourend Council\">Kourend Council</a>. However, they are unable to lend their assistance, as the Arceuus have chosen to keep their knowledge secretive. Frustrated, Mori then asks the adventurer to inform <a href=\"/w/Lord_Trobin_Arceuus\" title=\"Lord Trobin Arceuus\">Lord Arceuus</a>, as he cannot ignore the death of one of his people.\n</p><p>The player visits the <a href=\"/w/Tower_of_Magic\" title=\"Tower of Magic\">Tower of Magic</a> and informs the <a href=\"/w/Tower_Mage\" title=\"Tower Mage\">Tower Mages</a> outside of Thana's death, which they believe may be linked to the problem they are facing inside. Inside the tower, several souls have become violent and began to attack the mages, who the player slays with ease. Upon clearing the floor of the tormented souls, they meet with Lord Arceuus' son, <a href=\"/w/Asteros_Arceuus\" title=\"Asteros Arceuus\">Asteros Arceuus</a> and informs him of Thana's death.\n</p><p>Asteros informs the player their instruments detected fluctuations in the power of the <a href=\"/w/Dark_Altar\" title=\"Dark Altar\">Dark Altar</a>, causing them to feel a strange loss of power, as if the Altar itself had failed altogether. After realising this, Lord Arceuus used himself as a conduit to channel what little power the Dark Altar had left. This failure of the Dark Altar is what caused the experimental trapped souls to break free and turn feral, and caused Thana's death. Lord Arceuus' power is the only thing keeping his people alive. He then asks them to visit the <a href=\"/w/Tasakaal\" title=\"Tasakaal\">Tasakaal</a>, as they were the ones who gave his father the secrets of immortality.\n</p><p>The player heads to <a href=\"/w/Mount_Karuulm\" title=\"Mount Karuulm\">Mount Karuulm</a> to visit the Tasakaal, who initially refuse to help them after hearing of Arceuus' plight. However, after some convincing by the adventurer, they agree to help if the player tracks down a trapped soul. The player tracks and frees the soul from its torment, fulfilling their end of the deal. The Tasakaal also fulfill their end and inform the player that someone had placed a device to redirect the Dark Altar's power. The adventurer finds the device near the Dark Altar, and destroys it.\n</p><p>With the device destroyed, Lord Arceuus snaps out of his magical trance. The player informs him of the device they destroyed, and he sends researchers to investigate the broken device. Lord Arceuus is concerned that someone would deliberately try to sabotage the Dark Altar, but nonetheless thanks the player for saving his people.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bear_Your_Soul\">Bear Your Soul</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/Great_Kourend_quest_series?section=9&amp;veaction=edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: Bear Your Soul\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/w/Great_Kourend_quest_series?action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Bear Your Soul\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: <a href=\"/w/Bear_Your_Soul\" title=\"Bear Your Soul\">Bear Your Soul</a></div>\n<p>While assisting visitors of the <a href=\"/w/Arceuus_Library\" title=\"Arceuus Library\">Arceuus Library</a>, the player discovered a book that mentions a damaged ancient artefact.

However, as he has never travelled in this area before, he does not know how to complete the scroll. The player offers to help him complete the scroll, upon which they found an [[ancient casket]], which led to them hearing a faint whispering.\n\nRegardless, they deliver the casket to him. When asked about the contents of the casket, Veos will reply shiftily, saying \"''Oh err... Nothing important. Just something that might be of use to me back in Great Kourend.''\"\n\n===Client of Kourend===\n{{main|Client of Kourend}}\n[[Veos]] enlists the player's assistance to gather knowledge on the current state of Great Kourend's hierarchy and general social organisation for a [[Veos' Client|client]]. After visiting the five cities of Great Kourend, the client requested the player to activate a [[Mysterious orb (Client of Kourend)|mysterious orb]] near the [[Dark Altar]].\n\nThe player soon discovers that Veos does not recall any of the prior events, and he becomes possessed by the client, claiming that Veos is of good use to him as a conduit before making his grand entrance. When asked for his name, he will refuse, stating that all will be revealed in time.\n\n===The Queen of Thieves===\n{{main|The Queen of Thieves}}\nThe gangs of Great Kourend have been uniting under a mysterious figure called the Queen of Thieves, and [[Tomas Lawry]] is assigned to investigate this on behalf of the [[Kourend Council]], the ruling power of Great Kourend.\n\nThomas enlists the player's help in infiltrating the Saviours of Kourend, the gang that has absorbed many of the other gangs within Kourend. The player eventually discovers the hideout of the gang in [[The Warrens]], and kills [[Conrad King]], a senior member of a rival gang, the Vipers, in order to gain the trust of [[Devan Rutter]].\n\nAfter gaining his trust, Devan allows the player to gain an audience with their leader, the Queen of Thieves. She reveals herself as [[Lady Shauna Piscarilius]], the leader of [[Port Piscarilius|Piscarilius]]. She tells the player about the corrupt leadership of the [[Kourend Council]], and asks that they search the house of [[Councillor Hughes|Sophia Hughes]], one of the four members of the Council. The player then discovers that she has ties with the [[Disciple of Yama|Disciples of Yama]], a [[Zamorak]]ian cult, proving Shauna's claims.\n\nUpon returning to Thomas with this evidence, he promptly abandons his investigation and reports this to the Council, who have her arrested and locked up in the jail cells on the top floor of [[Kourend Castle]].\n\n===The Depths of Despair===\n{{main|The Depths of Despair}}\n[[Artur Hosidius]], the eldest son of [[Hosidius]]'s leader, [[Lord Kandur Hosidius]], has gone missing. Kandur will ask the player for assistance in searching for his son.\n\nAfter speaking to their chef, [[Chef Olivia|Olivia]], it is revealed that Artur was searching for the [[Royal Accord of Twill]], a document of historical significance, and had been spending most of his time in the [[Arceuus Library]]. There, the player finds a [[Varlamore envoy|book]] that may lead to the whereabouts of the Accord, and therefore Artur. After navigating the [[Crabclaw Caves]], the player finds Artur, and a chest containing the Accord.\n\nAs the player returns to Kandur, he will decide to keep the Accord for safekeeping and to use it as a leverage should the other Houses of Kourend cause him trouble.\n\n===Tale of the Righteous===\n{{main|Tale of the Righteous}}\n[[Phileas Rimor]]'s ancestor, Magnus Rimor, led an expedition to [[Mount Quidamortem]] in the [[Kebos Lowlands]] over a thousand years ago, and never returned, with the records declaring he perished along with the party.\n\nHowever, he received a parcel from an unknown individual containing an old journal written by King Shayzien VII, with a note on the parcel claiming the journal was stolen from the [[Tower of Magic]] during the uprising against [[Xeric]] in the 47th decade. Although most of the journal is illegible, he managed to find an extract stating \"''Quidamortem's creatures are compatible. The experimentation is proving successful and we will soon be ready to mass produce.''\"\n\nThe extract had a date in the 37th decade, and yet the expedition was declared a failure a decade before, leading Phileas to question why the king wrote about Quidamortem a decade after the failure of the expedition. He will ask the player to discover the truth about his ancestor's expedition by visiting the [[Library Historical Archive]]. Here, the player discovers evidence that the journal may be genuine, and is prompted by Phileas to perform the expedition once more. The player is granted permission to go on the expedition by [[Lord Shiro Shayzien]], who asks that any discoveries made be brought to him first, as King Shayzien VII was his ancestor and he wants to be made aware of any discoveries that may present him in a bad light.\n\nUpon arriving at the summit of the mountain, an expedition from the [[Varrock Museum]] reveals that they have uncovered a [[Quidamortem Cave|small cave]]. The player discovers a temple with an unstable altar, and brings the Museum expedition to investigate. The cave is revealed to have predated [[Xeric]], and he may have used this altar to extend his lifespan during his exile, suggesting that he may still be alive.\n\nUpon returning to Lord Shiro Shayzien, he asks for proof of the player's discoveries, and prompts the player to visit Phileas for the journal. However, players discover that his tent has been trashed and he himself has gone missing. Shiro will then open an investigation into his disappearance. Without the parcel, no concrete evidence can be linked to King Shayzien VII and the player's discoveries, but he will contact the research team and ensure they are documented.\n\n===The Forsaken Tower===\n{{main|The Forsaken Tower}}\n\n[[Undor]] has discovered the cause of the failure of the [[Doors of Dinh]], and sends a report to [[Councillor Unkar]], a member of the [[Kourend Council]], to request for assistance. The Doors of Dinh were created by the master blacksmith Dinh to imprison the [[Wintertodt]], an unknown entity which brings with it extremely freezing temperatures. The Wintertodt had previously ravaged Great Kourend 1,400 years ago, and it was only with Dinh and the Order of the Sacred Flame's help that the Wintertodt was sealed in its prison. With the doors failing, there is no telling what havoc the Wintertodt can wreak if it breaks free.\n\nThe player meets with Unkar at the [[Wintertodt Camp]], where he will explain that the Doors have been purposely damaged by someone or something, creating a small hole in the doors. Although not much, it is enough for the [[Wintertodt]] imprisoned within to draw a small amount of power into the prison. He can repair the damage, but he requires [[Dinh's hammer]], located in [[The Forsaken Tower (location)|The Forsaken Tower]].\n\nThe player travels to the Forsaken Tower to find Dinh's hammer, which is being safeguarded by multiple puzzles. They solve the ancient puzzles and eventually retrieve Dinh's hammer and return to Unkar, who repairs the damage. Despite the player's efforts, the Wintertodt manages to obtain a significant amount of power and now it is up to the Order's [[pyromancer]]s to subdue it.\n\n===The Ascent of Arceuus===\n{{main|The Ascent of Arceuus}}\n\n[[Mori]] is walking to the [[Arceuus Library]] with her friend [[Thana]] when they felt a strange power flow through them. Suddenly, Thana inexplicably dies without warning. Since the Ascent of Arceuus, an event over a thousand years ago which allowed all of Arceuus to become immortal, no member has died of natural causes. Mori catches the player passing by and tells them to inform the [[Kourend Council]]. However, they are unable to lend their assistance, as the Arceuus have chosen to keep their knowledge secretive. Frustrated, Mori then asks the adventurer to inform [[Lord Trobin Arceuus|Lord Arceuus]], as he cannot ignore the death of one of his people.\n\nThe player visits the [[Tower of Magic]] and informs the [[Tower Mage]]s outside of Thana's death, which they believe may be linked to the problem they are facing inside. Inside the tower, several souls have become violent and began to attack the mages, who the player slays with ease. Upon clearing the floor of the tormented souls, they meet with Lord Arceuus' son, [[Asteros Arceuus]] and informs him of Thana's death.\n\nAsteros informs the player their instruments detected fluctuations in the power of the [[Dark Altar]], causing them to feel a strange loss of power, as if the Altar itself had failed altogether. After realising this, Lord Arceuus used himself as a conduit to channel what little power the Dark Altar had left. This failure of the Dark Altar is what caused the experimental trapped souls to break free and turn feral, and caused Thana's death. Lord Arceuus' power is the only thing keeping his people alive. He then asks them to visit the [[Tasakaal]], as they were the ones who gave his father the secrets of immortality.\n\nThe player heads to [[Mount Karuulm]] to visit the Tasakaal, who initially refuse to help them after hearing of Arceuus' plight. However, after some convincing by the adventurer, they agree to help if the player tracks down a trapped soul. The player tracks and frees the soul from its torment, fulfilling their end of the deal. The Tasakaal also fulfill their end and inform the player that someone had placed a device to redirect the Dark Altar's power. The adventurer finds the device near the Dark Altar, and destroys it.\n\nWith the device destroyed, Lord Arceuus snaps out of his magical trance. The player informs him of the device they destroyed, and he sends researchers to investigate the broken device. Lord Arceuus is concerned that someone would deliberately try to sabotage the Dark Altar, but nonetheless thanks the player for saving his people.\n\n===Bear Your Soul===\n{{main|Bear Your Soul}}\n\nWhile assisting visitors of the [[Arceuus Library]], the player discovered a book that mentions a damaged ancient artefact. The player ventures out in search of this artefact, the [[Soul bearer]].\n\n===Architectural Alliance===\n{{main|Architectural Alliance}}\n\nThe [[statue of King Rada I]], the first king of Great Kourend, was destroyed by a devastating storm. The player gains the favour of the most prominent architects of all five houses and assists in rebuilding it.\n\n===A Kingdom Divided===\n{{main|A Kingdom Divided}}\n\nAfter the statue had been constructed, the player investigates the hidden corruption within the [[Kourend Council]], and discovers a much deeper conspiracy hundreds of years in the making.\n\n==Personalities==\n*[[Veos]]\n*[[Lady Shauna Piscarilius]]\n*[[Lord Kandur Hosidius]]\n*[[Artur Hosidius]]\n*[[Phileas Rimor]]\n*[[Lord Shiro Shayzien]]\n*[[Undor]]\n*[[Councillor Unkar]]\n*[[Mori]]\n*[[Lord Arceuus]]\n*[[Asteros Arceuus]]\n\n==Main Locations==\n*[[Lumbridge]]\n*[[Draynor]]\n*[[Arceuus]]\n*[[Hosidius]]\n*[[Port Piscarilius]]\n*[[Shayzien]]\n*[[Lovakengj]]\n*[[Mount Karuulm]]\n*[[Mount Quidamortem]]\n*[[The Forsaken Tower (location)|The Forsaken Tower]]\n\n==Current Rewards for Series==\n*9 [[quest point|quest points]]\n\n'''Experience'''\n*{{SCP|Thieving|2,000|link=yes}} [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Agility|1,500|link=yes}} [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Hunter|1,500|link=yes}} [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Mining|500|link=yes}} [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Runecraft|500|link=yes}} [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Smithing|500|link=yes}} [[experience]]\n*Two [[Antique lamp (Client of Kourend)|Antique lamps]] rewarding 500 [[experience]] each in a skill of the player's choosing.\n*One [[Antique lamp (X Marks the Spot)|Antique lamp]] rewarding 300 [[experience]] in a skill of the player's choosing.\n*One [[Antique lamp (A Kingdom Divided)|Antique lamp]] rewarding 10,000 [[experience]] in any chosen skill level 40 or above.\n\n'''Items'''\n*22,200 [[coins]]\n*A [[beginner clue scroll]].\n*[[Kharedst's memoirs]] and all of its pages.\n*3 [[Xerician fabric]] (dropped by [[Corrupt Lizardman]]).\n*A [[Kourend favour certificate]].\n*A [[Arceuus favour certificate]].\n*A [[Hosidius favour certificate]].\n*A [[Lovakengj favour certificate]].\n*A [[Piscarilius favour certificate]].\n*A [[Shayzien favour certificate]].\n\n\n'''New Locations'''\n*Access to [[The Warrens]].\n\n'''Other'''\n*Ability to fight the [[Corrupt Lizardman]] in the [[Nightmare Zone]].\n\n[[Category:Quest series]]"}

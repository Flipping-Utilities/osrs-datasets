She used this to her advantage many times during the war, breeding all kinds of plant life to use against us. One of these plants was the Blisterwood tree. The icyene used the sap of this tree to create poisons that were deadly to vampyres.}} which, alongside the powers of light that the icyene had that were lethal to vampyres, resulted in heavy losses among the vampyres. During this time, the [[Archpriest of the Unicorn]] and his followers also began to create safeguards for the [[Hallowed Sepulchre]]{{CiteNPC|loc=Archpriest of the Unicorn|quote=The [Justiciar of the Unicorn] said he was going to confront these [vampyres] but that I should stay to protect the secrets within [the Hallowed Sepulchre]...

We were winning, but with heavy losses.}} Although Lowerniel didn't mind the losses, seeing death in battle as a noble one,{{CiteNPC|loc=Vanescula Drakan|quote=Lowerniel didn't mind. He was a hunter and a warrior. In his eyes, there was no death more noble than one in battle.}} many others did not share that view, one of them being his brother, [[Ranis Drakan]]. He infiltrated Queen Efaritay's castle in the south-eastern part of the capital and captured Ascertes;{{CiteNPC|loc=Vanescula Drakan|quote=[Ranis] managed to infiltrate Efaritay's castle.

No one ever saw her again.

We needed a way to quickly restore our numbers. Vampyrification was the answer. [Ascertes] was the first of many to go through the process. He still lives to this day, under a different name of course. Vanstrom Klause.}} Upon being transformed into a powerful vampyre, the first thing that Vanstrom did was murder his daughter, Larina, and attempt to murder his son, [[Safalaan Hallow|Safalaan]], who was able to repel Vanstrom with his innate Icyene abilities and escape; this caused Safalaan to lose his memory. \n\nUpon capturing Queen Efaritay, morale in what remained of her army was lost, and the tide of the conflict turned; [[Phosani]], the [[Justiciar]] of the Wolf, alongside her companions [[Insela]] and [[Otrava]], felt that [[Saradomin]] had abandoned them,{{CiteNPC|loc=The turncloak|quote=Where's our god now?

Efaritay's castle was renamed [[Ver Sinhaza]] and was given to Lady [[Verzik Vitur]], the head of House Vitur.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Lore]]\n[[Category:Morytania]]\n[[Category:Locations]]"}

The Royal Guard maintains a strong presence throughout the Empire, although its activities can be seen most primarily in areas such as the [[Tree Gnome Stronghold]] and [[Battlefield|Battlefield of Khazard]]. The term Royal Guard is used somewhat rarely in-game, although during the [[Monkey Madness I]] [[quest]] it is referred to as such very frequently.\n\nThe Royal Guard was likely established in some form by the gnomish [[race]] in the early [[Fourth Age]], after it re-emerged from its [[God Wars]]-era hiding. It has since allowed the Gnome Empire to grow in strength and political prominence, and has defended the Empire during recent conflicts such as the [[Arposandran War]] and [[Khazard - Gnome War]].\n\nBesides using basic infantry troops, the Royal Guard also maintains an [[Armoured Tortoise Regiment]] and numerous [[glider]] units, the most celebrated of which is the [[10th Squad]]. The Guard has also become well-known for its [[terrorbird]] breeding programs, which provide many soldiers with effective mounts.\n[[Category:Organisations]]"}

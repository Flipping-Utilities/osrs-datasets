She then claimed some of the blood of <a href=\"/w/Kalrag\" title=\"Kalrag\">Kalrag</a>, a giant spider who had oft feasted on humans, and smeared some onto the doll as well. To recreate Iban's shadow, she performed an ancient and dark ritual known as Incantia: she summoned three demons, now bound as the keepers of Iban's shadow. Finally, to give Iban conscience, she took an innocent white dove and strangled it. She gave the corpse to a servant and locked him in a cage on the northern platforms.

Kalrag can hit somewhat hard (a max hit of 9), but is fairly inaccurate if you are wearing melee armour. The biggest challenge of this fight is often the swarm of spiders which can keep you from attacking Kalrag.

You can also try trapping Kalrag in the north-western corner of the cave, to make sure he's next to you after you kill a spider. Kalrag can be killed without it hitting you if you aggro it with a ranged attack and run past the stalagmites on the west side of the corridor, as its movement range ends a tile before those stalagmites it will back up until you have to move forward to keep attacking.

Since all these items start adding up quickly, the guide will tell you when a certain item is no longer needed anywhere in the quest and is therefore safe to drop. However, if you die, you will need to acquire these items again to get back to where you were.\n:'''Note:''' Ensure that you do not have a [[piece of railing]] in your bank. If you do, remove it from your bank before proceeding through the dungeon.\n\nThis quest relies heavily on your [[Agility]] skill, often making you complete a number of obstacles in succession. In most cases, failing any of the obstacles in an area will send you back to the beginning of the area, which can be quite frustrating, especially if your Agility is low. Many of the obstacles are harder to traverse if the player has a high equipment load. As the risk of all enemies besides the final encounter may be mitigated via safe-spotting or Protect from Melee, players should strike a balance between equipping [[Weight-reducing clothing]] and protective armour.\n\nMany of the traps in the dungeon damage you based on your '''current''' health. This means that by keeping your health relatively low, you will have to use less [[food]] through the dungeon than you would if you were to eat to full [[Hitpoints]] each time you get damaged.\n\n===The Pass to the Tyrant===\n[[File:Underground Pass start.png|thumb|Speaking to Lathas in his throne room.]]\nTo begin, talk to [[King Lathas]] on the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} floor of [[Ardougne Castle]]. He'll remind you about the [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground Pass]] and that it is the only way to reach the western lands in order to stop his corrupted brother [[King Tyras]]. Unfortunately, the evil [[Lord Iban|Iban]], who claims to be the son of [[Zamorak]], and his cultists have moved in. He'll ask you to check in with his head tracker [[Koftik]] who is waiting for you just outside the entrance to the Underground Pass. Your mission is to find a way to the other side of the dangerous pass and report back.\n\nThis time, you'll be allowed to go right through the front gates to [[West Ardougne]], so head through and walk all the way west through the city until you find the cave entrance with [[Koftik]] standing outside. Talk to him, and he'll explain more about the Pass. It is unlike other caves, being possessed of a corrupting darkness that breaks the will of men. He tells of the proud adventurer [[Randas]], who apparently heard the voice of Zamorak himself inside the cave, telling him how to achieve his greatest goals. Nobody has heard of him since. Koftik instructs you to meet him next to the bridge further inside.\n\n===Getting in and across the bridge===\n{{Needed|A [[bow]], [[arrows]], [[spade]], and [[rope]]. Bring the rest of your supplies now, '''including the spade''' as after this section there is no turning back unless you want to restart the entire dungeon.}}\n\nWhen you walk inside '''(#1)''', you'll see three paths branching off in different directions. ('''{{Colour|red|Warning}}: Do not take the middle path'''; the swamp will drag you down and send you tumbling down a hillside forcing you to crawl back up.) Instead, take the northern most path. Climb over a series of rocks around the swamp and get to where [[Koftik]] is standing next to a fire '''(#2)'''. There is a [[Stone tablet (Underground Pass)|stone tablet]] near the beginning. It contains an eerie text that you may read if you wish. Several more tablets will be encountered later on, written to celebrate Iban and his supposed heritage.\n\nTalk to him, and he'll tell you it looks like there have been others in the cave already. If you want, Koftik also shows you an excerpt of the diary of Randas that he found lying around. He'll give you an [[oily cloth]] from the remains of a camp and tell you he found charred arrows as well. If you later need another one, you can search the nearby pile of abandoned equipment to get more. Use the oily cloth on an arrow, and then use the result on the fire to get a [[fire arrow]]. You can stack several of these before lighting them in case you miss. Equip a bow and the arrows, And make sure that your 'attacks' are set to \"Longrange\" so that way you won't get the message \"I can't reach that!\".\n\n[[File:Underground Pass - Firing guide rope.png|thumb|230px|Shooting the guide rope with a fire arrow.]]\nGo north to get to the small area '''(#3)'''. Look across the subterranean river, and you can see where the guide rope holds up the bridge. Fire your lit arrow at the rope. If you succeed, the bridge will drop, and you'll automatically walk across the bridge.\n\n'''Do not''' pull the lever right after the bridge (it will send you back to the beginning).\n\n'''Before you continue, take the [[plank]] north of the lever (#4).'''\n[[File:Underground Pass - First area map.png|center|500px]]\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n#Cave entrance from [[West Ardougne]]\n#[[Koftik]]\n#Fire your [[Fire arrows|lit arrow]] here!\n#[[Plank]] spawn by [[blessed spider]]s\n#Use a [[rope]] on the overhang to cross the pit.\n#Grid\n#[[Furnace]]\n#Wall traps\n#Well to the second area\n{{Col-2}}\n:B - [[Giant bat]]s\n:G - [[Goblin]]s\n:O - [[Ogre]]s\n:S - [[Blessed spider]]s\n:Z - [[Zombie]]s\n{{Col-end}}\n\n===The pit===\n{{Needed|[[Food]] (strongly recommended) and 1 or more [[rope]].}}\nWalk south from where you picked up the plank. Do not walk into the swampy area filled with [[blessed spider]]s and instead head back east '''(#5)'''. You will come up on a pit and a small water crossing with a rope swing. Use your [[rope]] on the rock hanging from the ceiling above the dark pit.\n\n[[File:Underground Pass - Crossing the pit.png|thumb|230px|A player successfully swings across the pit.]]\n'''''If you fail and fall''', you will fall into a rocky pit and lose your rope. Follow the path on your mini-map climbing over rocks when needed to get to the muddy rock pile. You'll be placed at the very beginning of [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground Pass]]. You will need another rope to attempt the obstacle again. You can purchase ropes at the general store in Ardougne.''\n\n===The grid===\n[[File:Underground Pass - Grid.png|thumb|220px|The grid]]\nContinue down the path going east and then south. Eventually, you'll see [[Koftik]] standing in front of a grid '''(#6)'''. He is being affected by the voices you have been hearing in your chat, talking about the paths of righteous men and their being beset by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyrannies of the evil. He says you have to pick your own path next.\n\nMany of the tiles will drop you into a pit '''''dealing 15 damage to your health'''''. You'll need to use trial and error finding a safe path across. Once you've found a safe way across, remember it; you'll need it for [[Regicide]]. Pull the lever once you are across to lift the gate. The path is different for everyone. Not all grid paths are possible, you will never need to:\n\n* Walk backwards (to the east)\n* Walk diagonally to another cell\n* Walk north or south more than two cells on the same column\n* Walk north or south on the middle column (just walk straight west across it)\n\nThe grid puzzle '''always''' does 15 damage upon falling into a pit. Keep this in mind while trying new squares. Should you die from falling, your items will stay in the pit. To retrieve what you lost then, you must intentionally step on a square that will drop you into the pit. Once you get across the grid, there is an altar in the next important room, so you can use [[Rapid Heal]] to save some food.\n\n'''Remember or write down the path you used to get across. You have to come back through here *twice* during [[Regicide]] later; the correct path is permanent and unique to each player. (Your browser will remember the path saved in the grid below as long as you don't clear your browser cache).'''\n\nIt can be useful to keep track of the route you have to take using the following grid:\n\n{| class=\"underpasstable\"\n|{{#vardefineecho:table|<table class=\"lighttable\"><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr></table>}}\n|{{#var:table}}\n|{{#var:table}}\n|{{#var:table}}\n|{{#var:table}}\n|}\n\nWhen crossed, pull the lever on south to open the gate.\n\n===The orbs and the well===\n{{Needed|A [[plank]] (optional but suggested).}}\n\nTo the north there is a [[furnace]] '''(#7)'''. For the moment it can be ignored, but remember where it is. If you forgot to pick up the plank by the Blessed Spiders earlier there is another one that spawns just north-east of this furnace.\n\n'''{{Colour|red|Warning:}}''' If you use the obstacle pipe, it will cause you to go back to the rope swing with no return.\n\nHead west, to a narrow corridor '''(#8)'''. Approach it carefully, as there are five traps (odd markings) in the wall. (There's two on the north side followed by three on the south side.) There are two ways of passing the traps.\n\n#The traps can be disarmed normally, with a chance to fail and be hit for 5 to 14 damage.\n#Run through the traps one at a time, which hits a percentage of your current health, as low as 3. So keeping at above 10&nbsp;hp should be safe.\n:'''Note:''' Some guides suggest simply running through the trap by starting at the adjacent tile. This no longer works.\n[[File:Well of Iban.png|thumb|The Well of Iban and its surroundings.]]\nWhichever method you choose, you will eventually arrive to an area with an [[altar]] '''(#9)''' (note: this is a good opportunity to activate the [[Rapid Heal]] prayer, which will reduce the amount of food required later on) and a large, rather sinister-looking well in the centre. At this point you will be unable to climb down the well as a magical force prevents you from doing so whilst there is still light. Read the [[old journal]] lying by the well; it was written by Randas and describes how he had orbs of light blessed by Saradomin to keep the darkness at bay. You must destroy these [[orb of light|orbs]] to proceed. To complete this profane task, there are four different paths branching off from this room:\n\n:'''Note:''' Clicking on the well no longer deals damage if the orbs of light haven't been dealt with. Instead, it gives the clue that the orbs should be destroyed before one can descend deeper into the pass.\n:#Start with the very north passage. Use the [[plank]] you picked up earlier on the flat rock to disarm the three traps. Go past the traps and pick up the orb of light at the end of the tunnel.\n:#The next one (the next one to the left, north-west) is fairly easy as well. Run through the level 39 [[spider]]s and level 53 [[ogre]]s to grab the orb and run back again. You can activate [[Protect from Melee]] to minimize hitpoint loss.\n:#Go through the middle path next. Navigate the traps the same way as you did for the northern path.\n:#Traverse through the tunnel (south-west path). However, when you get to where the orb is, '''don't''' pick it up. Disarm the trap underneath it, and then grab the orb.\n:'''Note:''' Disarming can be failed, triggering a swinging log, dealing 6 to 13 damage.\n\nNow that you have all four of the orbs, back track a little bit. Go back to where the furnace was '''(#7)''' (remembering to be careful of the traps in the wall). Use each of the orbs on the furnace to destroy them.\n\nMake sure to top off your prayer if needed and head down the well '''(#9)''' descending another level. If you need food, search the crates at the west (crates give two [[salmon]] and two [[meat pie]]s).\n\n===The cages and the obstacle maze===\n{{Needed|[[Spade]] and [[food]].}}\n[[File:Underground Pass - Second area map.png|centre|250px]]\n\n#Entrance from the first area via climbing down the well\n#Dig by the mud patch with your [[spade]].\n#Narrow ledge\n#[[Agility]] maze\n#50 [[Thieving]] shortcut to bypass the maze\n#To the third area\n\n[[File:Underground Pass prison.png|thumb|The cells with slaves.|200px]]\nThere is some food in the crates right when you arrive down the well '''(#1)'''.\n\nHead west through the cave, and you'll find yourself in an area with a few cages containing [[Slave (Underground Pass)|slaves]] guarded by [[goblin]]s. You may enter the cells by picking their locks to talk to the slaves if you want ; their dialogue varies from pure gibberish to a friendly offer to cook you into soup. Pick the lock on the first one on the left (south-east). You'll notice that there's a rather odd-looking patch of ground at the back of it. Use your [[spade]] on this to dig through, and you'll find a hidden tunnel that will take you through to the other side '''(#2)'''. Do not drop your spade in case you fail the narrow ledge.\n\nEdge across the narrow ledge '''(#3)''', and you'll be near a maze of raised beams '''(#4)'''. However, '''you can skip this step with 50 [[Thieving]] as seen in the next paragraph'''. To get through it, you'll need to hop over a number of obstacles. If you fail, you need to climb back up one of the ramps nearby, often setting you back a few steps.\n[[File:Underground Pass maze.png|thumb|The rat-infested maze of ledges and spikes.|220px]]\nTo get through the maze:\n\n*Take the first right.\n*Then left.\n*Then another left.\n\nIf you have 50 Thieving, go a little bit further south past the maze to a door that you can pick the lock of '''(#5)'''. It completely bypasses the whole maze. Once through, head south to meet Koftik. He has clearly been corrupted by the voices to the point of insanity, although he claims the contrary himself. Squeeze through the pipe entrance to get into the next area '''(#6)'''.\n\n:'''Note:''' You can now drop your bow and arrows (if not relying on ranging for combat), spade, ropes, and any oily cloth you picked up earlier. They are no longer needed for the quest.\n\n===The caged unicorn===\n{{Needed|None.}}\n[[File:Underground Pass - Third area map.png|center|300px]]\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n#Entrance from the second area\n#[[Unicorn]]\n#[[Sir Carl]], [[Sir Harry]], and [[Sir Jerro]]\n#Well\n#To the fourth area (Iban's Lair)\n{{Col-2}}\n:S - [[Skeleton]]s\n:Z - [[Zombie]]s\n{{Col-end}}\nIn the next room, you'll find a group of [[skeleton]]s and a [[unicorn]] in a cage '''(#2)'''.\n[[File:Underground Pass - The unicorn.png|thumb|230px|The boulder that players must push down with the piece of railing.]]\nYou'll need its horn, but you can't get into the cage to get it. If you search the cage, you'll find a loose [[piece of railing]]. '''Note: If you already have a piece of railing in your bank, you're unable to obtain a new one.''' Take this, and head (south) up the path above where the cage is you'll find a large boulder. ('''Before moving the boulder, make sure that you have no items on the ground. As after the boulder is moved they will be gone!''') Use the loose railing to pry it loose, and crush the unicorn. Now, you can go back down and retrieve the [[Unicorn horn (Underground Pass)|unicorn horn]] by searching the [[smashed cage]]. Proceed through the tunnel entrance and head north.\n\n:'''Note:''' You can now drop your piece of railing. It is no longer needed for the quest.\n\n===The paladins===\n{{Needed|[[Food]], [[combat]] [[equipment]] and the [[Unicorn horn (Underground Pass)|unicorn horn]]. A [[plank]] is suggested, but not required.}}\n[[File:Doors of Iban.png|thumb|The imposing doors of Iban.]]\nHeading north through the cave, you'll come to a small group of [[Paladin]]s named [[Sir Carl]], [[Sir Jerro]], and [[Sir Harry]], who have made a sort of camp '''(#3)''', having been tasked by Lathas with the same mission but unable to open the locked Doors of Iban. Upon speaking with any of them, they will offer you some nourishment in the form of two loaves of [[bread]], two [[meat pie]]s, a bowl of [[stew]], a [[Prayer potion|prayer potion (2)]] and an [[Attack potion|attack potion (2)]]. (If you kill Sir Jerro before receiving supplies, you will not be able to get it, and he will attack you.){{Fact}} Afterwards, they suggest that you leave and let them finish the task.\n\nUnluckily for the paladins, you need the [[paladin's badge]]s that they carry and the only way to get them is to slaughter them. They're all level 62 and attack with melee. It is possible to [[safespot]] the paladins by attacking them and running west where they will not follow you.\n\nHead west keeping your eyes out for the traps there. Again, you can foil them by placing the [[plank]] on them. Keep going west to where there's another well '''(#4)'''. Its inscription says that the doors of Iban will not open as long as there is a beating, good heart present and the well demands the offering of such a creature's remains and three crests of the blessed. Use the [[Unicorn horn (Underground Pass)|unicorn horn]] and the three badges on the well to open the large doors '''(#5)''' conform its inscription.\nOnce you have all three badges (red, blue, and green), deposit them into the well along with the horn. The doors of Iban will open.\n\n:'''Note:''' You can now drop your plank. It is no longer needed for the quest.\n:'''Note:''' Remember this Well if you want to use the [[Iban's staff]] later. This is where you recharge it after use.\n\n===The dwarves===\n{{Needed|None.}}\n[[File:Underground Pass - Fourth area map.png|thumb|left|Iban's Lair]]\n''Now, you're in the largest area of the [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground Pass]] (and indeed all of [[RuneScape]]) and one of the most frustrating. Around all edges of the area is a rock ledge to walk on. The middle is a large, open area with a maze of walkways, most of which are broken. If you try to jump across them, sometimes, you will fall and end up taking big damage when you hit the ground below, as well as being in a large area filled with [[Soulless]]. Keep in mind that this area has been known to take well over an hour to clear, so be persistent.''\n\nThe doors lead to a massive cave and [[Koftik]] will appear again, declaring the place his home and Iban to be his friend. He mentions some 'foolish [[dwarves]]' that have taken up residence to the south and resist Iban. He tells you to slay them in his lord's name like you did the paladins.\n\nFor now, ignore the walkways, though do take note of the locations where you can get onto them. Walk down along the east wall and then west until you find a cave into which you can descend. Descend down into the cave. ''(Map of bottom level is found in next section.)''\n\n[[File:Underground Pass - Fifth area map.png|thumb|This is the level beneath Iban's Lair.|333x333px]]\nThere are three dwarves named [[Niloof]], [[Klank]], and [[Kamen]] in a small fenced area with two buildings just to the west. Niloof will be surprised to see a human and explain their group consists of miners unaware of the evil of Iban. The son of Zamorak has corrupted the only exit into the western lands, the [[Well of Voyage]], instead using it do dispose of his victims. You suggest to kill Iban, to which Niloof replies to seek out Iban's only confidante and guide, [[Kardia]], the witch who lives on the platforms above. He then gives you two more pies and a pizza.\n\nKlank explains the dwarves are the only ones not corrupted by Iban's voice. All humans have become [[soulless]] slaves of his, or possibly of Zamorak's himself. Those who resist are locked in cages until they are broken. He gives you a pair of [[Klank's gauntlets|sturdy gauntlets]] to protect against the soulless' vicious bite.\n\nFinally, Kamen is a little fried and asks you if you want some of his brew which 'will blow your head off' and advises to keep it away from naked flames. If you '''decline''', he will offer to sell you some [[bread]], [[stew]] and a [[meat pie]] for 75 coins; if you '''accept''', your [[Agility]] level will temporarily decrease by 4; he will then still offer the food for 75 coins.\n\nThere's a tinderbox spawn in the smaller eastern building, if you didn't bring one.\n\n===The ritual of Iban===\nGo back through the cave staircase used to enter the area, south-east of the dwarves. Go north-east until you reach the first walkway that can be used. Walk along it, jump the gap, and take the first turn south to find Kardia's house.\n\n[[File:Kardia's house.png|thumb|220px|The witch ranting about the dwarves.]]\nAttempt to open the door, or search the window, and you'll hear her talking to herself about her missing [[Witch's cat|cat]]. Head north, take the western path, hop across the gap and then take the north branch of the path. Follow it until you find the cat. It will be a yellow dot on your minimap. Grab it and go back to the witch's house again (if you drop the cat, you'll have to wait for a moment before you can grab it back).\n\nKnock on the door. You'll automatically hide behind the corner while the witch gets her cat. While she's distracted, open the door and sneak into her house to search the chest. You'll get a [[stat restore potion]], a [[super attack potion]], the [[history of iban]] and a [[doll of iban]].\n\nAlthough not absolutely necessary for progressing the quest, reading the book will reveal some background on [[Kardia]]'s revival of the insatiably ambitious [[Black Knight]] Iban after he had been slain by the [[White Knights]] in their [[Dawn Ascent]] operation. She vowed to resurrect him as undead so that he could fulfil his ambitions to create an army of soulless zombies. She explains how she brought his body to a tomb in the caverns beneath the Pass and smeared some of his flesh onto a doll bearing his likeness. She then claimed some of the blood of [[Kalrag]], a giant spider who had oft feasted on humans, and smeared some onto the doll as well. To recreate Iban's shadow, she performed an ancient and dark ritual known as Incantia: she summoned three demons, now bound as the keepers of Iban's shadow. Finally, to give Iban conscience, she took an innocent white dove and strangled it. She gave the corpse to a servant and locked him in a cage on the northern platforms. She finishes by noting that the same ritual would also undo Iban and destroy him. You now need to collect four elements of Iban to imbue the doll.\n\n:''You may drop the book to save inventory space, since it is not required for completion of this quest and only serves an informative purpose.''\n\n====Iban's body====\n{{Needed|A [[bucket]] and a [[tinderbox]].}}\n[[File:Underground Pass - Burning Iban's tomb.png|thumb|220px|Iban's tomb set ablaze.]]\nEither fall or jump back to the staircase to get back downstairs. Iban's tomb is in the south-eastern corner but cannot be opened. ''If you try to do so, a yellow claw will hit you for 10 damage.'' A nearby stone tablet says that only by burning the tomb will the corpse become available.\n{{cquote2|Only as flesh becomes ash,<br>\nand wood becomes dust,<br>\n...will Iban's corpse embrace<br>\nnature's eternal lust.}}\n\nEnter the larger building in the dwarven camp and pick up the bucket in the corner. Also speak to Niloof about the doll and the witch; he will confirm that you need to reverse Kardia's ritual and then throw the doll into the Well of the Damned. Next, go into the smaller building and pick up the tinderbox. Use the bucket on the barrel inside of the smaller house to get some of the [[dwarf brew]] that [[Kamen]] was offering you earlier.\n\nTake this and head back to Iban's tomb. Dump the bucket of alcohol on top of the tomb (only needs to be done once) and light it up with your tinderbox either by using it on the tomb or via the search option. After you're done watching it burn, a pile of [[Iban's ashes]] will appear in your inventory (or drop on the ground). The ashes will automatically be used on the [[Doll of iban|doll]] (unless the doll had been dropped, in which case you must do it manually).\n\n:'''Note:''' You can now drop your bucket and tinderbox. They are no longer needed for the quest.\n\n====Iban's blood====\n{{Needed|[[Food]], [[combat]] [[equipment]], and the [[doll of Iban]].}}\n[[File:Underground Pass - Fighting Kalrag.png|thumb|230px|A player uses a skeleton as a safespot to attack Kalrag.]]\n\nHead straight north from the tomb, and keep going until you reach a corridor full of [[blessed spider]]s (these have a max hit of 4). Run to the end of the corridor until you find a giant level 89 spider named [[Kalrag]]. Kalrag can hit somewhat hard (a max hit of 9), but is fairly inaccurate if you are wearing melee armour. The biggest challenge of this fight is often the swarm of spiders which can keep you from attacking Kalrag. If you're below 79 combat, it can be fairly difficult to finally get him alone to begin attacking, which is why it's advisable to run to the back of the corridor and start attacking him before the others get to you. Running behind the skeleton as shown in the picture to the right is a good way to safespot Kalrag and avoid any damage or aggro from the spiders.\n\nWhen you defeat him, you'll automatically soak up the blood with your [[Doll of iban|doll]]. '''The spiders nearby will attack you and can pile up on you despite not being a [[multi-combat area]]. They will interrupt the fight with Kalrag if they are attacking you. Once you kill Kalrag, you will be [[Stun (status)|stunned]] for about two seconds (and can be attacked by all spiders at once) so heal up before dealing the finishing blow. Using Protect from Melee is advisable.''' While stunned, you will automatically smear Iban's blood onto the doll.\n\nLow levels might have a problem with Kalrag as the blessed spiders will keep attacking, preventing the player from attacking him. This can be avoided by running alongside Kalrag, killing blessed spiders in the hope that Kalrag will be the next to [[aggro]] on you. You can also try trapping Kalrag in the north-western corner of the cave, to make sure he's next to you after you kill a spider. Kalrag can be killed without it hitting you if you aggro it with a ranged attack and run past the stalagmites on the west side of the corridor, as its movement range ends a tile before those stalagmites it will back up until you have to move forward to keep attacking. Repeat until dead.\n\nOnce you have killed Kalrag, exit the corridor.\n\n====Iban's shadow====\n{{Needed|[[Combat]] [[equipment]] and the [[doll of Iban]].}}\n[[File:Underground Pass - Fighting Othanian.png|thumb|230px|A player uses a stone bridge to safely attack Othainian.]]\n\nTo get [[Iban's shadow]], you need to kill three level 91 [[demons]] named [[Doomion]], [[Othainian]], and [[Holthion]]. Head north and then west from the witch's house, and take the first left (south) all the way down until you reach where the demons are.\n\nKill each one any way you like and pick up the [[amulet of doomion]], [[amulet of othanian]] [sic], and [[amulet of holthion]] that they drop respectively. If you are a low level or are using [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]], there are [[safespot]]s for killing the demons by standing on the narrow pathways. \n\n'''Note:''' After obtaining the demon's respective amulet, that same demon will no longer be aggressive towards you nor is it attackable. However, using manual magic cast still allows you to attack the demon without it being able to reciprocate—possibly an oversight from Jagex.\n\nThe last demon, [[Othainian]], may be difficult to safespot; lure him to the southern edge of the island, then run back to the narrow pathway and he will be stuck on the corner or safespot the demon from Doomion's isle. If using a halberd, you can safespot Othainian by staying on the narrow pathway segment that you land on after jumping over the narrow pathway. If you did not bring telegrab runes, it is strongly recommended to cross the bridge to his island before killing him, so that you do not have to kill him again if you fail the obstacle.\n\nOnce you have all three of them, head just north of where Doomion was to the chest. Opening it will remove the amulets from your inventory and give you Iban's shadow. It will automatically be used on the [[Doll of iban|doll]].\n\n'''Note:''' After using Iban's shadow on the doll, the demons are no longer aggressive nor are they attackable (unless using manual magic cast, which they won't retaliate to).\n\n====Iban's dove====\n{{Needed|[[Klank's gauntlets]] and the [[doll of Iban]].}}\n:''Make sure you put on [[Klank's gauntlets]] to avoid taking damage from the [[half-soulless]].''\n\nMake your way to the northern part of the upper level. There will be several cages with [[half-soulless]] in them, one of whom has the remains of the dove. Do not bother with the first batch of cages; skip it and continue south until you see a broken bridge you can jump over. Make your way across.\n\nTake the first path north to a cage. From the first cage head east to the next cage. Head north and take the very first left (west) to a cage. Equip Klank's gauntlets if you haven't already and search the cage for [[Iban's dove]]. Sometimes there is no popup telling you that you found it, so keep an eye on your chatbox. The zombie will exclaim 'Kuluf Ali Monopiate'.\n\n'''Note:''' The remains will automatically be smeared onto the doll when searching the correct cage.\n\n===Killing Iban===\n{{Needed|[[Doll of Iban]].}}\n[[File:Underground Pass confronting Iban.png|thumb|The stand-off against Iban.]]\n\nNow, to finally destroy Iban and bring an end to this quest. You'll need to jump your way to Iban's temple in the centre of the area. Once you're there, kill a [[disciple of Iban]] and take his [[Zamorak monk robes]].\n\n'''(Should you die attempting to dispose of the doll, you will have to run through the entirety of the dungeon again, so be sure to bring the items required with you.)'''\n\nEnter the temple wearing both upper and lower Zamorak robes. Iban will recognise the doll and declare he cannot die, as well as that you are Zamorak's slave regardless. He then begins to attack you, represented by red spikes that will haphazardly appear near the entrance for several ticks. These spikes rapidly deal around 5 to 8 damage each and can't be blocked with prayers. They also stun you and teleport you back to the entrance, so make sure you run in with plenty of health. Running directly to the well should be fairly easy with one or two food items.\n\n''A method to never get hit by Lord Iban's spell is to enter the temple, immediately exit and then walk back inside, which should roughly coincide with the end of his first round of attacks. Then quickly run to the well in the centre of the room and use the doll before he launches his next volley.''\n\nUse the [[Doll of iban|doll]] on the Well of the Damned in the centre of the room. '''You may have to do this a few times, as his attacks may interrupt you.''' When you do manage to get the doll into the well, Iban will be taken by darkness and destroyed utterly. The temple will begin to collapse and you drop into a cavern below. You also receive [[Iban's staff]], which the man had dropped.\n[[File:Underground Pass Iban's attack.png|thumb|Iban's fearsome attacks.]]\n'''Note: You can use the doll on the well while in dialogue. It’s possible to reach the well before being attacked, taking 0 damage.'''\n\nMake your way through this cave to meet [[Koftik]], who will be sane again and suffer from memory loss with Iban's voice suddenly gone. You inform him that you have slain Iban and vaguely remember some of your actions such as crushing the unicorn and killing the paladins, unsure whether it really happened. He will lead you back to the entrance of the Pass.\n\nLeave the cavern and return to [[Ardougne]] to tell [[King Lathas]] of your success to finish the quest. He will thank you for your service and enquire whether the passage to the west is now clear. Upon being told that the temple was destroyed, he says he will send his mages to clear the well so that you can stop his brother Tyras, who he reminds you joined forces with the [[Dark Lord]] on his expedition after being corrupted by the [[Chalice of Eternity]].\n\n'''Note:''' For souvenir collectors, '''all quest items will be removed upon completing the quest'''. In order to keep the desired quest item(s), it/they should be dropped before speaking to King Lathas to complete the quest.\n\n'''Congratulations! Quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Underground Pass\n|image = [[File:Underground Pass reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 5\n|rewards = *{{SCP|Agility|3,000}} [[Agility]] [[experience]]\n*{{SCP|Attack|3,000}} [[Attack]] [[experience]]\n*[[Iban's staff]] and use of the [[Iban Blast]] spell.\n*[[Klank's gauntlets]]\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Underground Pass is required for the following:\n*[[Legends' Quest]]\n*[[Regicide]]\n*[[Freeing Sir Amik Varze]]\n*[[Ardougne Diary|Ardougne Achievement Diary - Medium]]\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 25 July 2019\n|update = Song of the Elves\n|change = Several changes are made to the Underground Pass quest, along with the release of [[Song of the Elves]]. These changes include, but are not limited to:\n* The entire Underground Pass quest now takes place in an [[instance]].\n* [[Koftik]] no longer appears in multiple locations inside the dungeon, during the quest. Instead, he moves along with the player's progress, and a backpack containing [[damp cloth]] is left behind near the rope bridge instead.\n* The three paladins ([[Sir Carl]], [[Sir Harry]], and [[Sir Jerro]]) no longer respawn after their badges have been dropped in the well. Similarly, one cannot get duplicates of the orbs of light.\n* The patches of swamp found further in the dungeon are removed. Previously, there were swamps located near the [[blessed spider]]s just across the rope bridge, as well as inside the [[Thieving]] shortcut area in the first area with [[Agility]] obstacles.\n* [[Iban's shadow]], [[Iban's ashes|ashes]] and [[Iban's dove|dove]] are now automatically applied to the [[doll of iban]] when obtained with the doll in the inventory.\n* Iban has some dialogue when you first enter his temple and now only attacks when there is someone inside.\n* Kamen's homemade brew no longer damages the player between 3-5 [[Hitpoints]].\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Prior to being fixed, [[mithril seeds]] could be exploited to cross the grid puzzle effortlessly. When automatically moving west one space each time a flower is planted, the player will safely move across the grid without triggering the trap. This was patched in 2016; however, a new workaround arose where you could place the seeds after stepping onto the first tile, meaning there was a chance of failure. This method was also patched, in 2018. Theoretically, it was also possible to burn logs to cross the grid in the same fashion; however, doing so would have required too much inventory space to be effective.\n*If you speak to [[Koftik]] at the mesh grid, he will say \"''The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men''\". This is the beginning of the misquoted Bible verse \"Ezekiel 25:17\" that Samuel L. Jackson's character, Jules, recites in the movie ''{{wp|Pulp Fiction}}''. He may also say \"''The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result''\", a quote often incorrectly attributed to {{wp|Albert Einstein}}.\n*The player can also hear voices that Koftik and other NPCs hear, when examining objects or items there's a chance that they will be replaced with certain phrases of a chaotic nature.\n*Before when attempting to climb down the well, found in the room with the orbs of light and a Chaos Altar, the player would take 10 damage. However, if the player was below 10&nbsp;hp they would lose the remaining hitpoints minus 1. This has since been removed.\n\n{{Underground Pass}}"}

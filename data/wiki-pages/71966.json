After a while, you will be at a crossroads, one route heading north and another heading south-east. It is recommended players try the south-eastern route first. If you cannot slash this web, skip the next paragraph.\n</p><p>If you are able to slash through this web, search the two chests in this room that must be unlocked through their right-click option. Only one of the two chests will open, the other one will give a message indicating it can't be opened. Search this chest to receive a <a href=\"/w/Combat_scratched_key\" title=\"Combat scratched key\">combat scratched key</a>. Continue further east and then north until the path meets up with the alternate route. Continue reading after the next paragraph, where the two routes meet back up.\n</p><p>If you were unable to slash through the webs in the southern room, head into the northern (inner) route. This will lead you to a room containing two chests, of which only one can be unlocked using its right-click option; the other one will indicate it can't be opened through a message in the chat box. Search the opened chest to receive a <a href=\"/w/Combat_damaged_key\" title=\"Combat damaged key\">combat damaged key</a>. Slash the web to the east and meet up with the other route.\n</p><p>After meeting back up with the other route, continue north and pass through another big room. The route for the next section will be entirely determined by the key you obtained earlier. If you obtained a \"combat <b>scratched</b> key\", take the eastern route. If you obtained a \"combat <b>damaged</b> key\", take the western route.\n</p><p>There are some traps in this section that can be <b>completely ignored</b> if taking the correct route based on the key, by quickly running past them on the route. These traps are present in this section:\n</p>\n<ul><li>The dart traps can be disarmed for 28 <a href=\"/w/Thieving\" title=\"Thieving\">Thieving</a> experience, but do not seem to shoot players on the correct route unless the player stands still in their line of sight for multiple seconds. If shot, the darts will deal fairly rapid damage and may inflict <a href=\"/w/Poison\" title=\"Poison\">poison</a> starting at 8 damage.</li>\n<li>The floor blade traps will occasionally raise up, dealing fairly low damage and pushing the player out. These deal less damage than the maniacal monkeys around it, so it is highly recommended to just run past them instead of waiting for the right timing.</li>\n<li>The spinning blade trap can also be disarmed for 28 <a href=\"/w/Thieving\" title=\"Thieving\">Thieving</a> experience. Disarm the trap, or run past it to take a small amount of damage (up to 6, based on current hitpoints).</li></ul>\n<p>After this section, open the door with your key. It is also possible (but highly discouraged) to pick the lock on the door to get 50 <a href=\"/w/Thieving\" title=\"Thieving\">Thieving</a> experience, however this has a chance of inflicting <b>poison dealing 6 damage</b>. After the door, there will be several more of the same traps. Simply keep running north and then west until you meet up with the agility route from here.\n</p><p><span style=\"color:red;\"><b>Warning!</b></span> There is currently a glitch that makes it possible to get stuck between the spinning blade trap and the eastern (combat scratched) door, without the ability to go back past the spinning blade trap, if attempting to take the north-easternmost route despite not having the proper key for that route. Players who have the <a href=\"/w/Combat_damaged_key\" title=\"Combat damaged key\">Combat damaged key</a> should make sure to take the <b>western</b> route. If you happen to get stuck, you cannot progress and need to teleport out and reset.

Glough's melee attack can send you flying backwards and dealing up to <b>66 damage</b> as a result. For this reason, it is recommended that players keep their health at 80+ to avoid dying as a result of this attack. <b><a href=\"/w/Protect_from_Melee\" title=\"Protect from Melee\">Protect from Melee</a></b> is highly suggested if using melee equipment to attack him. Glough will only teleport you after he is damaged, or if the player is not directly adjacent to him. <a href=\"/w/Rings_of_recoil\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rings of recoil\">Rings of recoil</a> are suggested, especially if attempting to partially <a href=\"/w/Safespot\" title=\"Safespot\">safespot</a> him as detailed below. Therefore, it is recommended to keep <a href=\"/w/Auto-Retaliate\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Auto-Retaliate\">Auto-Retaliate</a> disabled and only attack Glough when the player is not in danger of dying as you are unable to eat during, and shortly after being teleported.\n</p><p>Glough's magic attack drags the player within distance of his melee attack and deals a large amount of damage. However, it may be exploited to only allow for damage from his magic attack. To do this, use a strong <a href=\"/w/Ranged_weapon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ranged weapon\">ranged weapon</a> such as the <a href=\"/w/Toxic_blowpipe\" title=\"Toxic blowpipe\">toxic blowpipe</a>, stand one square west of Glough, and attack.

His damage seems to be roughly halved using the correct <a href=\"/w/Prayer\" title=\"Prayer\">prayer</a>. If using this strategy, it is advisable to bring combo foods (e.g. a 'main' food, <a href=\"/w/Shark\" title=\"Shark\">sharks</a> or <a href=\"/w/Tuna_potato\" title=\"Tuna potato\">tuna potatoes</a>, with <a href=\"/w/Pineapple_pizza\" title=\"Pineapple pizza\">pineapple pizzas</a> and/or <a href=\"/w/Saradomin_brew\" title=\"Saradomin brew\">brews</a>/<a href=\"/w/Super_restore\" title=\"Super restore\">restores</a> and/or <a href=\"/w/Karambwans\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Karambwans\">karambwans</a>) more one-click foods (e.g. tuna potatoes) over a brew/restore method, as the tick for you to move one square away and use your potions is not enough to counteract his damage. It is also possible, albeit difficult, to eat a karambwan, a high healing food and a potion all in one tick.\n</p><p>Another technique to use is when Glough teleports you to him, <b>Protect from Melee</b> and use melee attacks. When Glough pushes you away, <b>Protect from Missiles</b> and use ranged attacks. The toxic blowpipe and <a href=\"/w/Whip\" title=\"Whip\">whip</a> are great weapon choices.

Glough's house is located just south-east of the [[Grand Tree]]. Climb up the ladder and then climb up the tree on the other side of the house. Now, right click the tree branch, and select 'Investigate'. You will receive a [[handkerchief]] that has the initials 'A.A.' embroidered on it.\n\nYou will then need to speak to his girlfriend [[Anita]], located in her house up the most north-western staircase in the [[Gnome Stronghold]]. She will be in tears. Ask her what's wrong, and she will begin telling you that she is worried Glough may be seeing another woman. Tell her that Glough might be in trouble, and that you may be able to help her. She tells you that she heard whispering upstairs in his house but couldn't reach the higher level.\n[[File:Monkey Madness II - Glough's house.png|thumb|220px|The player in Glough's house.]]\nReturn to Glough's house, and climb up the tree twice to reach the additional level of his house. Investigate the gnome statue to activate a hidden switch. Now, search the cupboard to receive a [[book of spyology]]. Read through it — the book mentions a method to reveal text on a document encrypted with spycraft. Search the crates to the north-west to receive a [[brush]], and investigate the fire remains to receive a [[mysterious note]]. Follow these steps in order to decrypt the note:\n#Use your [[pestle and mortar]] on the [[lemon]] to apply it to the note. Caution, left clicking the lemon first will consume it.\n#Use the note on the nearby candles (or a [[lit candle]]).\n#Use your pestle and mortar on the [[grapes]] to apply it to the brush.\n#Finally, use the [[juice-coated brush]] on the mysterious note to receive a [[Scrawled note (Monkey Madness II)|scrawled note]], which is written in the ancient Gnome language. Read the note.\n\nIf you don't already have the [[translation book]], return to King Narnode, and talk to him to obtain the book. Use the book on the note before speaking to the king again. (You may already have this book in your bank from [[The Grand Tree]] quest.) He will suggest you speak to the book's author, who is Anita. Go back to her, and ask her to translate it for you. She will give you a [[translated note]]. Read it, and return to King Narnode, who discovers it was [[Assistant Le Smith]] who helped Glough escape.\n\nTalk to [[Assistant Lori]] south of Glough's tree and ask who he is. He will tell you that he is Le Smith's replacement, and that he does not know what happened to him, and recommends that you ask [[Auguste]] about it. Fly to [[Entrana]] using the balloon. This requires one [[regular log]]. '''You must bank all of your weapons and armour at this point, as you cannot bring them to Entrana.''' If you wish to save time getting back to the Gnome Stronghold, bring one [[magic log]] with you as well so that you can return quickly via balloon. Talk to [[Auguste]] who will explain that Le Smith was lost while attempting to travel to [[Ape Atoll]] via air balloon.\n\nReturn to King Narnode, who will tell you to travel to Ape Atoll, to speak with [[Garkor]].\n\n===Chapter II===\n{{Needed|[[Pickaxe]], [[m'speak amulet]], [[monkey talisman]], [[Ninja monkey greegree (medium)|ninja monkey greegree]] or [[ancient gorilla greegree]], [[light source]], [[slash weapon]].

It is filled with several 130+ [[Combat level]] monsters, which will hit very consistently. Prepare accordingly, and keep your health and [[Prayer]] high at all times.\n\n'''Tip:''' A [[monkey talisman]] can be re-obtained from the [[monkey child]] for free or bought from [[Tutab's Magical Market]].\n\n{{Map|name=Garkor|x:2806,y:2761|plane=0|mapID=0|mtype=square|r=3|height=250|width=250|align=right|caption=Where to find Garkor.}}\nMake your way to [[Ape Atoll]] (Fairy Ring CLR), and head to the northern section of the island. ''(Wear your [[M'speak amulet]] and a [[ninja greegree]] or [[gorilla greegree]].)'' On the eastern side of the island, speak to [[Garkor]], who will tell you to speak to [[King Awowogei]]. Talk with Awowogei, and ask him about military plans. He will explain that he will not speak to anyone other than [[Kruk]]. Report back to Garkor. You will need to find and kill Kruk to create a [[greegree]] from his remains to disguise yourself as him.\n\nHead onto the hill west of the main gate to where the [[monkey archer]]s are; one of them should have a talk option. Talk to the monkey, and ask him where Kruk is. He will tell you that he has been disappearing from his post a lot lately, and that he would start tracking him from the bottom of the hill. Head back down the hill, and you should see some tracks/footprints. Follow them to a hidden trapdoor near a tree. (The trapdoor is south of the northern transport-icon.)\n\nOpen the trapdoor and enter [[Kruk's Dungeon]]. The greegree will lose its effectiveness when you enter the cave and \"wrench itself from your hands.\" '''<u>If your inventory is full, the greegree will drop to the ground when you enter.</u>''' [[Kruk]] is located behind the handholds north of the entrance. You will have to walk across the whole dungeon which is full of traps, [[Agility]] obstacles and monsters to reach him. There are two ways to approach the dungeon.\n[[File:Monkey Madness II - Kruk's dungeon entrance.png|thumb|250px|Location of the trapdoor.]]\n\nBelow is a map of [[Kruk's Dungeon]]:\n[[File:Kruk's Dungeon map.png|600px|centre]]\n====The Agility Method====\n:'''Note:''' The correct path is random for every player.\n\nPlayers with level 70 [[Agility]] or higher are recommended to take this route, as it is much less dangerous. This section of the dungeon will consist of many obstacles in which there is only one correct path. You will often have to find out which course is the right way using trial and error. You can fail navigating the obstacles; however, if the game gives a message stating {{Colour|Red|Something about this route feels wrong...}}, then that path has a '''100%''' fail rate for you. A [[light source]] is recommended as the bottom floor is dark, and you will be bitten by insects continually until you leave the area.\n\nIf you fall after the '''first two''' holes with vines (not vine obstacles), you will drop to the bottom floor rooms filled with [[maniacal monkey]]s which only use [[Melee]] on you, '''so use [[Protect from Melee]] if you fall'''. After the '''third and fourth''' holes, the bottom floor monkeys will use '''[[Ranged]], so make sure to activate [[Protect from Missiles]].''' After the '''fifth''' hole, the monkeys go back to using '''Melee'''. Be aware that each hole serves as a \"checkpoint\" of sorts, so falling to the bottom floor will not take you to the beginning of the course past the second hole, nor is it possible to advance through the dungeon in the bottom floor. \n\n*To begin the agility method, you will want to start heading south and then east. When you first begin the course, you will come across the [[Dodgy ground]]. All you have to do is to follow the flat-looking parts of the ground. (Stepping onto one of the parts covered with an \"X\" will result in you setting off the trap, and you will fall.)\n\n[[File:Bronze_key_(MM2)_location.png|thumb|The location of the chest that possesses the bronze key.]]\n\n*Continue passing obstacles until you reach a very large room filled with the dodgy ground. You will need to get to the door on the east side. If you fall here, [[pray melee]]. Follow the correct path on the ground until you make it to the chest. Unlock (right-click) and search the chest to receive the [[Bronze key (Monkey Madness II)|bronze key]].\n\n'''Note:''' If you need to teleport out before you reach the end of the dungeon (reaching the strange wall), taking a second key is recommended to save time.\n\n*Go back out onto the dodgy ground, and make your way north. Use your bronze key on another door to continue through the maze.\n*Once you make it to the northern end of the cave past all the obstacles, take the '''western''' corridor to go to Kruk's lair. The eastern corridor is the [[tanking]] path.\n\n'''{{Colour|Red|Warning:}}''' If you should teleport out or die after passing the [[Bronze Door]], you need to get the bronze key again!\n\n====The Tanking Method====\n{{Needed|A [[slash weapon]] to break webs and a [[pickaxe]] to clear rocks.\n|recommended=Good [[tanking]] [[equipment]]}}\n\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_crossing_Kruk's_dungeon.png|thumb|220x220px|A player navigating through obstacles in Kruk's dungeon.]]\n\nThe dungeon is in an oval sort of shape, so it is pretty straightforward to navigate your way through it. The tunnels are all [[multi-combat]]. There are many [[aggressive]] monkeys, in addition to the odd [[scorpion]] or [[snake]].\n\n*The monkeys can deal very high damage quickly, even with good [[tanking equipment]]. It is recommended to use [[Protect from Missiles]] as the [[Maniacal Monkey Archer|monkey archers]] have a much longer range and deal just as much damage as the melee ones.\n*For your consumables if taking the tanking route, it is best to bring [[Saradomin brew]]s to get as much healing as possible. [[Super restore]]s are not needed unless you are planning to kill Kruk on the same run.\n*Runes for [[Blood Burst]] or [[Blood barrage|Barrage]] are useful to heal off the maniacal monkeys if you need to.\n\nMake your way east through the dungeon slashing webs and mining rocks. After a while, you will be at a crossroads, one route heading north and another heading south-east. It is recommended players try the south-eastern route first. If you cannot slash this web, skip the next paragraph.\n\nIf you are able to slash through this web, search the two chests in this room that must be unlocked through their right-click option. Only one of the two chests will open, the other one will give a message indicating it can't be opened. Search this chest to receive a [[combat scratched key]]. Continue further east and then north until the path meets up with the alternate route. Continue reading after the next paragraph, where the two routes meet back up.\n\nIf you were unable to slash through the webs in the southern room, head into the northern (inner) route. This will lead you to a room containing two chests, of which only one can be unlocked using its right-click option; the other one will indicate it can't be opened through a message in the chat box. Search the opened chest to receive a [[combat damaged key]]. Slash the web to the east and meet up with the other route.\n\nAfter meeting back up with the other route, continue north and pass through another big room. The route for the next section will be entirely determined by the key you obtained earlier. If you obtained a \"combat '''scratched''' key\", take the eastern route. If you obtained a \"combat '''damaged''' key\", take the western route.\n\nThere are some traps in this section that can be '''completely ignored''' if taking the correct route based on the key, by quickly running past them on the route. These traps are present in this section:\n* The dart traps can be disarmed for 28 [[Thieving]] experience, but do not seem to shoot players on the correct route unless the player stands still in their line of sight for multiple seconds. If shot, the darts will deal fairly rapid damage and may inflict [[poison]] starting at 8 damage.\n* The floor blade traps will occasionally raise up, dealing fairly low damage and pushing the player out. These deal less damage than the maniacal monkeys around it, so it is highly recommended to just run past them instead of waiting for the right timing.\n* The spinning blade trap can also be disarmed for 28 [[Thieving]] experience. Disarm the trap, or run past it to take a small amount of damage (up to 6, based on current hitpoints).\n\nAfter this section, open the door with your key. It is also possible (but highly discouraged) to pick the lock on the door to get 50 [[Thieving]] experience, however this has a chance of inflicting '''poison dealing 6 damage'''. After the door, there will be several more of the same traps. Simply keep running north and then west until you meet up with the agility route from here.\n\n{{color|red|'''Warning!'''}} There is currently a glitch that makes it possible to get stuck between the spinning blade trap and the eastern (combat scratched) door, without the ability to go back past the spinning blade trap, if attempting to take the north-easternmost route despite not having the proper key for that route. Players who have the [[Combat damaged key]] should make sure to take the '''western''' route. If you happen to get stuck, you cannot progress and need to teleport out and reset. The lock on the door can be picked to find a safespot if needed for a home teleport.\n\n====Reaching Kruk====\nThe two paths converge at the north end of the dungeon. Continue west, where there is another vine serving as the final \"checkpoint\". There are three [[maniacal monkeys]] near it, so [[pray melee]] until they cannot reach you. The path will then divide into a western and eastern route which both end in a separate final wave of dodgy ground. '''After the last obstacle (vine or wall support) and before stepping onto the dodgy ground before Kruk's lair,''' investigate the nearby wall as indicated on the map to unlock a shortcut back to the entrance.\n\nAfter searching the wall, move on past the dodgy ground, or go to the bank to re-stock for the battle against [[Kruk]]. Use the shortcut when you return to skip to the end of the cave. The cavern entrance just south of the dodgy ground will lead to Kruk's chamber.\n\n====Killing Kruk====\n{{Needed|[[Weapon]] and [[armour]] to kill [[Kruk]], [[food]] and [[prayer potion]]s.\n|recommended=An emergency teleport.}}\n{{Instance}}\n'''{{Colour|Red|Warning:}}''' [[Kruk]] can be very difficult to kill, even for the well-prepared.\n\nWhen you enter the room with [[Kruk]], there will be some short dialogue, after which Kruk will attack. Kruk uses a combination of [[melee]] and [[ranged]] attacks. His ranged attack is stronger, with a max hit of '''37''', so turn on '''[[Protect from Missiles]]''' when you attack him. '''Keep your health above 40 at all times, as Kruk can still hit up to 33 with melee.''' Kruk has no particular weakness to any attack style. When attacking Kruk, the best method is to attack with range using [[stamina potions]]. This is similar to fighting [[Commander Zilyana]]. Attack and run away, staying out of melee range. This method reduces the amount of high hits from Kruk. Keep in mind you will still be hit by certain ranged attacks. It may be optimal to pray [[Eagle Eye]] and [[Steel Skin]], or [[Rigour]], in addition to Protect from Missiles. Given high enough combat, Kruk can be easily meleed without [[flinching]] with [[Protect from Melee]] and [[Piety]], while only using a few [[sharks]] to be safe. However, lower levelled players are recommended to flinch Kruk. To trap him, stand next to a cave wall in such a manner that there is a cave wall directly '''north''' or '''south''' of you, with Kruk standing diagonally from you. Attack Kruk everytime his health bar disappears and directly step back to the original square, in order to prevent him from damaging you back.\n\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_fighting_Kruk.png|thumb|220x220px|The player faces Kruk.]]\nAfter killing Kruk, take [[Kruk's paw|his paw]] and exit the dungeon through the rope west of the chamber. This rope will lead you back up in the ruined building where you hid from the [[monkey's aunt]] during [[Monkey Madness I]]. You now need to make a [[Kruk monkey greegree]] with his paw and a [[monkey talisman]]. You must navigate through the [[Ape Atoll Dungeon|tunnel]] you originally trekked through during the original [[Monkey Madness I]].\n\n'''Note:''' Wearing a [[greegree]] will prevent you from being attacked by the undead monkeys and [[spider]]s inside (an [[anti-poison]] or similar will make you immune to spike damage), but falling rocks will still damage you. It is highly advised to bring a [[stamina potion]], [[super energy potion]]s and [[food]] when going to [[Zooknock]].\n\nSpeak to Zooknock, and talk to him about the quest you are on - he will create the Kruk monkey greegree for you. He will warn you that he cannot be certain how taking his form will affect you, as Kruk was quite powerful before his death. Teleport out of the dungeon once you get the greegree, equip it, and return to [[Awowogei]]. He will reveal that the monkeys are planning another attack with the help of the [[Gu'Tanoth]] [[ogre]]s and the generals of the [[Troll Stronghold (location)|Troll Stronghold]]. With this information, '''talk with [[Garkor]]''' to finish Chapter II.\n\n===Chapter III===\n\n====Defeating Kob and Keef====\n\n{{Needed|[[Weapon]], [[armour]] to kill [[Kob]] and [[Keef]], and 20 [[coins]] (unless the player has 71 Agility).|recommended=[[Trollheim teleport]] or [[stony basalt]], [[ring of dueling]], [[Yanille]] or [[Castle Wars]] teleports for fast access to [[Gu'Tanoth]], some [[food]].}}\n\n=====Kob=====\n\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_Fighting_Kob.png|thumb|220x220px|The player challenges Kob to a deathmatch.]]\nHead to the [[Troll Stronghold (location)|Troll Stronghold]]. Run to the south-westernmost room on the main level and challenge [[Kob]] to a deathmatch. It is '''highly recommended''' to use the [[Protect from Melee]] prayer before speaking to him and accepting his challenge, as he can hit up to 57. However, Kob can still hit through Protect from Melee with a max hit of 28. Players should either [[pray melee]] or safespot Kob by running out to the door and using [[Ranged]], [[Magic]], or a [[halberd]], as he will not be able to reach you. When he is defeated, Kob will beg for mercy and agree to not help the monkeys.\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_Fighting_Keef.png|left|thumb|220x220px|The player and Keef fight to the death.]]\n\n=====Keef=====\n\nYou will need to go to [[Gu'Tanoth]] and find [[Keef]], who can be found near the other [[city guard]]s past all the bridges (where you solved the riddle a guard gave you in the [[Watchtower Quest]]). Bring 20 [[coins]] to pass the bridges again. Players with level 71 Agility can use the shortcut near Keef to save time.\n\nChallenge Keef to a deathmatch; Keef has a high max hit of 47 and can hit through [[protection prayers]], albeit at a reduced output. As Keef is a large [[NPC]], you can use the nearby tree as a safespot. '''Be sure to activate Protect from Melee before you enter the dialogue with him.''' When Keef nears death, he will beg for mercy and agree not to help the monkeys.\n\n====Back in Ape Atoll====\n{{Needed|[[Kruk greegree]] and [[M'speak amulet]].\n|recommended=[[Ape atoll teleport]], [[weight-reducing clothing]], [[Energy potion|energy]], [[super energy]], or [[stamina potion]]s, [[hammer]], [[chisel]], [[food]].}}\n\n=====Assistant Le Smith=====\n\nReturn to Garkor to tell him that the [[ogre]]s and [[troll]]s have agreed not to help the monkeys.\n[[File:Assistant_Le_Smith_location.png|thumb|220x220px|A possible location of Assistant Le Smith.]]\nHe will tell you to go and look for [[Assistant Le Smith]], who can be found somewhere on [[Ape Atoll]] on the rooftops or other high places within the city. There are four possible locations:\n* On top of the bridge that connects the two watchtowers of the main gate.\n* Top floor (up two ladders) of the broken building next to the [[Monkey Child]] and [[The Monkey's Aunt]].\n* Top floor of the jail. To access the top floor, climb the ladder by [[Solihib's Food Stall]], then walk northwards and climb the ladder north of the bamboo bed.\n* Top floor of the building west of the [[Magic Stall]]. To access this building, climb the ladder at the southern end of the [[Temple of Marimbo]]. Then, climb the ladder on the north-west corner of the building, then run all the way south-west to reach the aforementioned building.\n** Alternatively, go to the building east of the magic stall and search the south-east crate to enter a cave. Go to the west end of the cave and climb up the rope. '''Warning:''' You will take heavy damage (30+) from falling in to the dungeon, which '''can''' kill you if your [[Hitpoints]] are low.\n\nSpeak with Le Smith by telling him that you were going to ask him the same question followed by asking him why and about the ships, and he will inform you that the monkeys are constructing a fleet of ships on the west coast of Ape Atoll.\n\nTalk to Garkor before heading west to the north-western coast of Ape Atoll. While wielding [[Kruk's greegree]], speak with the monkey by the rowboat located on the north-western corner of Ape Atoll. He will take you to the platform.\n\n=====The airship platform=====\n\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_airship_platform_map.png|left|thumb|A labelled map of the airship platform.]]\n[[File:Airship_platform.png|thumb|220x220px|The airship platform.]]\nNow, on the platform, you will be transformed back into human form. You will have to collect six [[Satchel (Monkey Madness II)|satchels]], fill them with explosives, and then place the charges around the platform.\n\nGuards are all over the platform, and if you get caught by one, you will be thrown out of the platform. Each guard's line of sight is 2-4 squares in front of them, including the square they stand on. [[Run trick|Corner tricking]] the guards are highly advised as it can save time. You may want to memorise the patrol patterns of the guards so you do not accidentally bump into one.\n\nBegin by following the main path, skipping the first ladder to the north. Continue until there is a ladder at a dead end. Go up the ladder (note that there is another ladder to go up to the {{FloorNumber|uk=2}}; ignore it for now), and continue south until you reach another ladder. Climb down this ladder and follow the path to find the satchels. Make sure to collect six satchels before going back up the ladder you just climbed down, around the corner, and back down to the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}}.\n\nReturn to the first ladder you encountered, climb up, and follow the path around until you reach another ladder. Climb down this ladder and follow the path north, and you will eventually reach a barrel with the explosives. Fill up '''all''' of your satchels before making your way to each of the locations where charges must be placed.[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_airship_platform.png|thumb|220x220px|A player stealthily navigating through the airship platform.]]\n\n:{{Colour|Red|'''Warning:'''}} If you are caught by the guards, the explosives will be soaked and become useless, forcing you to get more explosives again. However, you will keep the empty satchels and any charges you've already planted will stay on the rig, even if you log out. '''When you finish planting all the charges, DO NOT teleport out; leave via the same ladder you came in.''' Leaving at any point in this way will not reset the explosives.\n\n[[File:Monkey Madness II - corner_tricking.gif|thumb|216x216px|Corner tricking a guard]]\nCharges must be placed on two pillars on the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}}, two floorboards on the middle floor, and two gas canisters on the top floor. One of the floorboards is immediately south of the ladder when you climb back up. One of the pillars is back towards the start. Planting a satchel on a pillar along the way, go back to the dead end ladder on the {{FloorNumber|uk=0}} and climb up. Up again is to the two gas canisters (in each direction), while the last floorboard is to the west across a [[Vine (Monkey Madness II, airship)|vine swing]] and to the north. Once you plant the last explosive, your character should acknowledge this. Leave the platform via the ladder by which you arrived (to speed up this part, you can let a guard find and throw you out of the platform).\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_talking_to_Glough.png|left|thumb|220x220px|The player sat atop a mutated gorilla, discussing plans with Glough.]]\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_Glough's_device.png|thumb|220x220px|Glough's device, using charged onyx gems to infuse power for his mutagens.]]\n\n=====Back to Kruk's dungeon=====\n\nReport back to Garkor and then head to [[Kruk's Dungeon]] where you defeated [[Kruk]] in the maze. You can skip traversing the maze by heading north and using the monkey bars with Kruk's greegree equipped. With Kruk's greegree still equipped, enter the passage to the north (don't head back to Kruk's room or go up the vine). Walk through the big doors straight ahead, climb onto the [[stunted demonic gorilla]], and climb down the stairs where three [[tortured gorilla]]s roam. If you did not bring a [[hammer]] and [[chisel]], you can search the crates downstairs until you find one of each. \n\n[[Glough]] will be in a cage, and orders you to send the three tormented gorillas back into their cage. Riding on your stunted demonic gorilla, attack all three tormented gorillas one at a time. Use [[Protect from Melee]] to negate the damage they deal to you. When they reach low health, the gorillas will go back into the cage.\n\nGlough will now speak to you, claiming the last strain of mutagen was too unstable. You ask how large is this army of creatures he has prepared, and he tells you that he is currently only using the test subjects, but once he perfects the mutagen into an airborne form, he'll be able to unleash it across Ape Atoll. He then pulls a lever, activating a [[device]] that uses charged onyx gems to infuse power for his mutagens. He will then teleport out to find Le Smith.\n\nNow that he's gone, go onto the nearby holding area to dismount from the demonic gorilla. Climb back up the stairs, unequip the greegree, and take the [[charged onyx]] out of the device at the north end of the room. Use the chisel and hammer to invert the flow of energy, creating a [[deconstructed onyx]]. Place it back in the device; then, investigate any one of the incubation chambers to confirm that energy has been drained from the incubator, successfully corrupting it.\n\nReport back to Garkor. He will tell you to report to [[Awowogei]] that the trolls and ogres have backed out of the alliance, and that the secret weapon has had some complications and is too unstable to use on the battlefield. Frustrated, he cancels the assault on the mainland and strips Kruk of his rank and duties. Return to Garkor and inform him Awowogei has called off the attack. Suddenly, the screen will shake and a cutscene will play, showing Glough has proceeded with his attack plans anyway on his airship.\n\n===Chapter IV===\n{{Needed|[[Weapon]] and [[armour]] to defeat [[tortured gorillas|tortured]] and [[demonic gorillas|demonic]] gorillas, [[food]] and [[prayer potion]]s.\n|recommended=An emergency teleport.}}\n{{Instance}}\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_airship_above_stronghold.png|thumb|250x250px|Glough's airship hovering directly above the Gnome Stronghold.]]\nReport to [[King Narnode Shareen]] that the [[Gnome Stronghold]] will be attacked by the airship. He will recommend that you recruit [[Nieve]], the highest-skilled warrior they have. Nieve can be found by the entrance to the [[Stronghold Slayer Cave]]. Ask for her help in defending the Stronghold, and she will agree, having her cousin [[Steve]] take her place.\n\n{{bug|If the player talks to Steve from this point on, until the quest is finished, he will have Nieve's chat head instead.}}\n\nBy simply walking around the Stronghold with Nieve, tortured gorillas will appear. (Re-logging and standing in the west/southwest area to the entrance to the grand tree seems to encourage their spawns) They will only use melee attacks, so they can be [[safespotted]] using various trees and scenery in the Stronghold. Kill four of them, and return to the bank if necessary. If Nieve disappears at any time, she will be outside the Grand Tree. If you cannot find her there, logging out and then logging back in will return her. You can also hit the \"[[Call follower]]\" button in the bottom of the [[Worn Equipment]] interface.\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_Glough's_crashed_airship.png|left|thumb|220x220px|The remains of Glough's airship after it crash lands just north of the stronghold.]]\nGo back and talk to the King. He will have the 10th Squad take care of the rest while you and Nieve head to the crash site and confront [[Glough]] should he still be alive. After that, head north-west of the [[Grand Tree]], and talk to [[Garkor]]. He is located by the [[Swamp toad (item)|swamp toad]] and [[king worm]] swamp and the [[tortoise]] enclosure. Go through the crash site and enter the [[Crash Site Cavern]]. There are four more tortured gorillas outside; players do not have to kill these, so [[pray magic]] or [[pray range|range]] and run past them.\n\nPrepare to fight two [[Tortured gorilla|tortured]] and two [[demonic gorilla]]s. After walking through the cavern (do not take the stairs, as it leads nowhere) you will see Glough has survived the crash, and has brought his best experiments with him.\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_Fighting_Glough's_gorillas.png|thumb|250x250px|The player and Nieve fight side by side against Glough's experiments.]]\nAfter the cutscene ends, the tortured gorillas will move in and attack; these are slightly stronger than the ones you fought outside and can use multiple [[combat styles]]. When you kill one of the tortured gorillas, a demonic gorilla will jump down into the fight. The demonic gorillas are far stronger, boasting more health and damage. Most notable is their ability to use [[protection prayer]]s, which act similarly to the player's prayers in a [[PvM]] situation (Player vs. Monster); however, [[Verac's set]] '''will not''' hit through their [[Protect from Melee]], so you '''must''' bring two forms of [[combat]] if you kill them normally.\n\nShould you die here, Nieve will be waiting outside the [[Grand Tree]] upon your return.\n\nThe demonic gorillas have all three attack styles. Their white 'throwing' attack is [[Ranged]], green is [[Magic]], and fighting melee is [[Melee]]. Protect accordingly! It is also possible to let Nieve kill all four gorillas for you. Wait for her to start attacking one of the gorillas; then, run out of the room and hide behind the pile of rocks. For the demonic gorillas, ensure that they are not using Protect from Melee; if they are, keep attacking them with magic or ranged until they change prayers so Nieve can hit them. '''Nieve will not attack the gorillas if you use \"[[Call follower]]\"; additionally, it will take Nieve some time to [[aggro]] the gorillas if you end the cutscene early.\n\n'''Note:''' If you are on a [[black demon]] slayer task, the demonic gorillas count as on task kills, and a [[Slayer helmet]] may be used.\n\n'''Additional Note:''' Nieve will <u>NOT</u> attack the Gorillas if they are not in the room they jumped down into. You will need to get them stuck as shown in the photo to the right only after having them attack you.\n[[File:Monkey Madness II - Nieve fight safespot.png|thumb|An easy place you can hide whilst allowing Nieve to defeat the gorillas for you]]\n'''For Struggling Players:''' If you are having difficulty killing all the gorillas, simply kill both the tortured gorillas that appear; then, leave the room and hide in such a way that the demonic gorillas get stuck behind the wall. '''You MUST tank a few hits from a gorilla in order for Nieve to attack as she will only attack the last monster you were in combat with.''' For example, after you've killed one or both of the tortured gorillas, [[tank]] a few hits from Demonic Gorilla 1 so that Nieve knows which one to attack; then, hide and let her finish off that specific gorilla. Repeat these exact steps for the second demonic gorilla. If they are praying Protect from Melee, use ranged or magical attacks until they switch to [[Protect from Missiles]] or [[Protect from Magic|Magic]], and then hide again.\n\n===Chapter V===\n{{Needed|[[Weapon]] and [[armour]] to fight [[Glough]], [[food]] and [[prayer potion]]s.\n|recommended=An emergency teleport.}}\n{{Instance}}\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_Nieve_dies.png|thumb|220x220px|Nieve is killed by a collapsing boulder after Glough's transformation.]]\nAfter defeating the [[demonic gorillas]] Glough will drink his own mutagen, transforming himself into an abomination and then retreating. [[Nieve]] will attempt to stop him, but gets knocked back to the wall, causing a boulder to fall and crush her, killing her instantly. Players will now have to defeat [[Glough]]; '''it is recommended to return to a bank and restock on supplies, as the fight will prove to be challenging even to the most experienced player.'''\n\nThe player will need to fight Glough in three separate chambers, which he goes to when his health falls.\n\n'''Note:''' If the player leaves the chamber through [[teleportation]], [[death]] or through the exit at any point during the fight with Glough, all progress is reset back to the first phase. For this reason, it is suggested to '''read this entire section before proceeding'''.\n\n====Phase 1 & 2====\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_Glough_phase_1_safespot.png|thumb|220x220px|A safespot available to use in the first phase.]]\nIn the first room, [[Glough]] attacks using [[Melee]] and can be attacked safely from the hallway using [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]]. Once Glough falls to 75% health, he goes into the second room.\n\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_Glough_phase_2_safespot.png|thumb|220x220px|The safespot for Glough's second phase. The player here is standing in the centre of the room where they fight Glough in Phase 1.]]\nIn the second room, Glough uses ranged attacks as well as melee, stomping the ground and dealing up to 30+ damage. It is possible, but difficult, to [[safespot]] him by using a weapon that has an [[attack range]] of 10 squares (in order of preference as they may be available: [[twisted bow]], [[bow of faerdhinen]], [[dark bow]], [[magic comp bow]], [[crystal bow]], or [[magic longbow]]. Notably, the magic comp bow still has an attack range of 10 squares on 'Rapid' and can double-hit Glough on his third phase if you are attempting to safespot him).\n\nTo do this, you will have to lure him to one square east of the first black rock on the southern wall and when you have done that, then stand exactly one square out of his attack range, which is about halfway through the room where he went for the first phase. It is suggested to activate '''[[Protect from Missiles]]''' as this reduces his damage a bit; but he can still hit up to 21 damage with each attack. Lure Glough out of the second room and back into the first, hugging the northern parts of the wall. When you lure Glough far enough, he will not do anything, allowing you to easily hit him. Once he falls to 50% health, he will walk into the final room.\n\n====Phase 3 Strategy #1====\n[[File:Battle_with_Glough.png|thumb|250x250px|Glough drags the player towards him during the final phase of the fight.]]\nIn the third and final room, [[Glough]] will now be able to attack the player using both melee and magic attacks. Glough's melee attack can send you flying backwards and dealing up to '''66 damage''' as a result. For this reason, it is recommended that players keep their health at 80+ to avoid dying as a result of this attack. '''[[Protect from Melee]]''' is highly suggested if using melee equipment to attack him. Glough will only teleport you after he is damaged, or if the player is not directly adjacent to him. [[Rings of recoil]] are suggested, especially if attempting to partially [[safespot]] him as detailed below. Therefore, it is recommended to keep [[Auto-Retaliate]] disabled and only attack Glough when the player is not in danger of dying as you are unable to eat during, and shortly after being teleported.\n\nGlough's magic attack drags the player within distance of his melee attack and deals a large amount of damage. However, it may be exploited to only allow for damage from his magic attack. To do this, use a strong [[ranged weapon]] such as the [[toxic blowpipe]], stand one square west of Glough, and attack. Whenever he teleports you to him using his magic attack, quickly return to the square just west of him and continue attacking him. '''[[Protect from Magic]]''' is highly recommended if using ranged or magic to kill Glough, as his teleport deals very high magic-based damage. His damage seems to be roughly halved using the correct [[prayer]]. If using this strategy, it is advisable to bring combo foods (e.g. a 'main' food, [[shark]]s or [[tuna potato]]es, with [[pineapple pizza]]s and/or [[Saradomin brew|brews]]/[[Super restore|restore]]s and/or [[karambwans]]) more one-click foods (e.g. tuna potatoes) over a brew/restore method, as the tick for you to move one square away and use your potions is not enough to counteract his damage. It is also possible, albeit difficult, to eat a karambwan, a high healing food and a potion all in one tick.\n\nAnother technique to use is when Glough teleports you to him, '''Protect from Melee''' and use melee attacks. When Glough pushes you away, '''Protect from Missiles''' and use ranged attacks. The toxic blowpipe and [[whip]] are great weapon choices. Also a [[Dragon halberd|dragon]] or [[crystal halberd]] works wonderfully to chunk Glough's health.\n\n====Phase 3 Strategy #2====\n''It is possible, but requires skill, timing and a good connection to kill him in his third phase without taking any damage at all with a [[Attack range|10 square-range weapon]].''\n\nIt is possible to partially [[safespot]] [[Glough]] on his final form, preferably with a [[dark bow]] because of its double attack. Interestingly, the [[magic comp bow]] and [[Magic longbow|magic long bow]] will also shoot twice if using this method (#1 below); the second time immediately after being teleported, even while spam clicking away from Glough. Safespotting him, especially with method #2, requires great timing and experience with RuneScape's .6 tick system. Glough has an [[attack range]] of 11 squares and an aggression range seemingly between 14-18 squares (it is difficult to tell). There are two ways to go about doing this. Either way, set up [[quick prayers]] for [[Protect from Magic]] and [[Eagle Eye]] or [[Rigour]].\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_Glough_phase_3_method.gif|thumb|350x350px|A player demonstrates the safespot technique for Glough's third phase, attacking once to be dragged in, and another attack before running back quickly.]]\n\n#Turn on quick prayers and then attack him. He will draw you (teleport) to him. If you want or need to conserve [[Prayer]], switch it off mid-'flight.' After (or during, it doesn't make a difference) being teleported, '''very quickly''' (spam click on the minimap) run back at least 11 squares (1 square north of the small black boulder).\n#Similar to [[flinching]], you can continuously run between the previous chamber and the hallway to cancel Glough's aggression. You will have to '''RUN''' from the square just north of the rocks, as shown on the animation. The first few times you do this before 'getting the hang of it,' you should use the quick prayer set up just in case he teleports you, or he could hit upwards of 60 damage. He can be killed very slowly but relatively safely using this method. ''If you are using magic, cast your spell out of the spell book, '''DO NOT use autocast''', as you will spend a tick standing around before actually using the spell.''\n#Running or walking back has little impact on this method. Using a [[blowpipe]], you can land two hits on Glough and eat before he draws you back in with his magic attack. This allows you to do a constant barrage of attacks without having to worry about your health. Although it is recommended to use a blowpipe, a [[crossbow (weapon)|crossbow]] will work as well, only you will be able to: A) land one hit with a healing method, or B) land two hits without a healing method. If you are already at your maximum [[Hitpoints]], you can revert to more damage dealing methods such as a dark bow in place of eating as well.\n\nStart the battle by attacking Glough in his first room, then running out into the room you entered through. Glough will get stuck between the passageway and you can safely attack him down to 75% health while taking no damage. [[Protection prayers]] are '''not''' needed for this stage of the fight as Glough only uses melee.\n\nFor the second phase, run in and attack Glough. He will attack with a ranged attack, but protection prayers '''do not''' affect this attack. Run back into the first room Glough was in and go behind the grey rock. As long as you're behind the line parallel to the rock, Glough can't hit you. From here, you can safely attack Glough down to 50% health. Make sure you're using [[long range]] if using a [[longbow]].\n\nFor the last phase, you must first run up to the grey rock in the passage near Glough. Be careful not to go past the rock. Set your quick prayers to Protect from Magic and Eagle Eye or Rigour if you have them. Turn them on, attack Glough, and right when you start the attack animation, spam click behind the grey rock on the [[mini map]]. Then, move right behind the grey rock again, restore Hitpoints and Prayer if needed, and repeat until Glough is defeated.\n\nIf using the Magic comp bow, once he has teleported you, if you click him the next tick, and then move back to the safe spot, you can get a second shot off per teleport, this can be done with Rapid selected.\n\n'''Note:''' If you and Glough die at the same time, '''you will''' have to repeat the entire fight again.\n\n===Finishing up===\n[[File:Monkey_Madness_II_-_ending_cutscene.png|thumb|250x250px|Meeting with Awowogei and Narnode to negotiate peace.]]\nOnce [[Glough]] is defeated, the cavern will begin to collapse. You will automatically be teleported outside the cavern in the nick of time by [[Zooknock]], who decided to pull you out after detecting a very powerful presence within the cavern, but couldn't get a lock on [[Nieve]]. You will explain that Glough has been defeated and that Nieve perished in the battle. You will then be instructed to report back to [[King Narnode]], and he will offer to teleport you directly to the King.\n\nReport to King Narnode, telling him that Glough has been defeated and that his demonic creations have been trapped deep within the caverns. He will then tell the player that he received a message that [[Awowogei]] himself wishes to visit the Stronghold and set up a peace treaty between [[Ape Atoll]] and the mainland. He decides to accept this offer, and a cutscene will ensue where Awowogei will negotiate a peace treaty with King Narnode Shareen with you as witness to this moment of historic importance, opening up the gates to [[Marim]] to the mainland for all.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name=Monkey Madness II|image=[[File:Monkey Madness II reward scroll.png|center]]|qp=4|rewards=*{{SCP|Slayer|25,000}} [[Slayer]] experience\n*{{SCP|Agility|20,000}} [[Agility]] experience\n*{{SCP|Thieving|15,000}} [[Thieving]] experience\n*{{SCP|Hunter|15,000}} [[Hunter]] experience\n*Access to the [[Crash Site Cavern]] containing [[Demonic Gorilla]]s.\n*The ability to communicate with monkeys without the [[monkeyspeak amulet]].\n*All [[NPC]]s on the surface of [[Ape Atoll]] will be [[non-aggressive]] without requiring the use of [[Monkey greegree]]s.\n*Access to [[Ape Atoll]] bank and [[Oobapohk's Javelin Store]].\n*Access to new [[glider]] spot directly to Ape Atoll.\n*2x 50,000 [[experience]] rewards from [[Duke]] in your choice of [[Magic]], [[Ranged]], [[Attack]], [[Defence]], [[Strength]] or [[Hitpoints]].

[[Mountain Daughter]] plays Asleif's singing, [[Sins of the Father]] plays a melancholic tune, while [[Regicide]] and [[Recruitment Drive]] play nothing.\n*During the [[cutscene]] in which the player (disguised as [[Kruk]]) meets Glough, he teleports out of the cage using the incantation \"''Umesc pro ta lauf!''\", which is translated as \"''Soul to the eye!''\", suggesting the spell teleports the caster to where their eyes are focused upon.\n**When he leaves to search for [[Assistant Le Smith]], he uses the incantation \"''Umesc pro ta andra!''\", which is translated as \"''Soul to the city!''\", suggesting the spell teleported him to [[Marim]], where Le Smith is found.\n*When telling [[Juna]] a story about the quest, the player says \"... so I defeated Glough in his mutant form and prevented a war. King Narnode Shareen & King Awowogei signed a peace treaty.\" to which she responds \"Glough's evil plans always threaten to upset the balance of our world. I am pleased you were able to stop him.\"\n*After the quest, most monkey NPCs on Ape Atoll will still speak to the player as if they were an ordinary monkey. Exceptions include [[Duke]], the [[Monkey child]] (as he is normally spoken to in human form), the [[Monkey archer]] when entering or exiting the gate of [[Marim]] (he will say \"an ''ally'' wishes to pass\"), and [[Awowogei]].\n*A [[Update:Monkey Madness II: Log In Competition|log in screen competition]] was held the week before release to use a player-made log in screen for the [[Main Menu]] in order to commemorate the first quest to be released on ''Old School RuneScape''. The winner of the competition, ''Golden Pleb'', was given a 3D printed model of a [[demonic gorilla]] and a t-shirt signed by the ''Old School RuneScape'' team.\n*When you inform Awowogei that the trolls and ogres have backed out of the alliance, that the airships have been destroyed, and that the secret weapon is unstable, Awowogei says \"You've failed me for the last time, Kruk.\" This is likely a reference to Darth Vader's line, \"You have failed me for the last time, Admiral,\" in The Empire Strikes Back.\n*If you finish Keef with a multi-hit attack (e.g. the [[dragon dagger]] or [[dragon halberd]] specials), he will forfeit once for each finishing hit, with the same dialogue each time.\n*When confronting Glough in the Crash Site Cavern and Nieve says \"I swear by my shiny blue shield that I will end you right here.\", it may be a reference to the line from the TV show Firefly \"I swear by my pretty floral bonnet that I will end you.\"\n*When spotted by the guard monkeys on the airship platform, they will display \"!\" above their heads.

Using an [[Oculus orb]], the full text can be seen.\n*During the airship platform stealth portion of the quest, examining a piece of an iron barred gate laying against a crate gives the message \"''They're trying to build a prison for you and me to live in.''\" This is a reference to the chorus of the 2001 track ''Prison Song'' by System of a Down.\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" widths=\"180\">\nMonkey Madness II artwork.png|A piece of artwork of the quest.\nMonkey Madness II login screen.png|The log in screen upon the release of the quest.\nMonkey Madness II log in screen competition prize - 3D printed demonic gorilla.jpg|The 3D printed demonic gorilla given to the log in screen competition winner.\n</gallery>\n\n{{Monkey Madness II}}"}

A very few characters completely lack a gender, such as the <a href=\"/w/Homunculus\" title=\"Homunculus\">Homunculus</a>.\n</p><p>Several non-human <a href=\"/w/Boss\" title=\"Boss\">bosses</a> have a gender revealed by lore or their examine text — for example, <a href=\"/w/Cerberus\" title=\"Cerberus\">Cerberus</a> is referred to as \"her\" when in a <a href=\"/w/Boss_lair_display\" title=\"Boss lair display\">Boss lair display</a> and <a href=\"/w/Kree%27arra\" title=\"Kree&#39;arra\">Kree'arra</a> said he is male during the <a href=\"/w/2014_Birthday_event\" title=\"2014 Birthday event\">2014 Birthday event</a>.

Also, there is almost always a difference in armour between when it is worn by a male player and when it is worn by a female player. This can commonly been seen on [[body slot]] armour; for example, a male player wearing [[Verac's brassard]] has an exposed chest, but a female player will have a piece of cloth covering her chest.\n\nOf particular interest is the [[Vyrewatch outfit]], which completely changes depending upon the players gender. Notably, [[Vyrewatch shoes]] look like high-heels on female avatars.\n\nAt the [[Hairdresser]] in [[Falador]], male characters can change their beard or hairstyle for 1,000 coins each. Since female characters cannot have beards, their haircuts cost 2,000 coins.\n\n===Quests===\nGender plays little role in enhancing or limiting any particular abilities in ''[[RuneScape]]'' with the notable exception of the [[Recruitment Drive]] quest, which requires the player to be female. Male characters will need to change their gender in order to complete the quest; however, this quest rewards the [[Makeover voucher]], which entitles the player to a free use of the Makeover Mage to change back to male.\n\nThere is a minor restriction based on gender in [[The Giant Dwarf]], in which the player must choose a mining company to join. Female characters may not join The Brown Engine, and male characters may not join The Yellow Fortune. Characters of either gender may still choose freely from any one of the remaining six companies, except The Red Axe, which no player may join.\n\nDuring [[Throne of Miscellania]], male characters must convince [[Princess Astrid]] to marry them, and female characters must convince [[Prince Brand]] to marry them. Players cannot choose which gender they would prefer to be with, thus both Astrid and Brand seem to be heterosexual. If you speak with [[Advisor Ghrim]] after completing Throne of Miscellania as a male and have since changed your gender to female, he will act as if you completed the quest as a female and vice versa.\n\n==Non-player characters==\n[[Non-player character|NPCs]] often refer to the player using gender-specific pronouns and titles. For example, [[Rick Turpentine]] says \"Excuse me, Sir/Ma'am\" when calling out to the player.\n\nMany NPCs have a well-defined gender, and these are not limited to [[human]]s. For example, [[Aga]] the troll and [[Zanik]] the goblin are female, while [[Doric]] the [[dwarf]] and [[Pescaling Pax]] the [[Penguin (race)|penguin]] are male. We can discern these from the fact that other NPCs refer to them as \"she\" or \"he\" respectively.\n\n[[Humans Against Monsters|H.A.M.]] members are divided into male and female, and it is apparently easier to pick the pockets of females than males; players can pickpocket a [[female H.A.M. member]] at level 15 [[Thieving]], but they need level 20 Thieving to pickpocket a [[male H.A.M. member]].\n\nLow-level NPCs, known only as \"[[Man]]\" and \"[[Woman]],\" are commonly found in [[Lumbridge]] and other places. Unlike H.A.M. members, it is equally easy to pick the pockets of either gender, each requiring only level 1 [[Thieving]].\n\nMost regular non-human [[monster]]s are genderless - for example, [[troll]]s and [[goblin]]s that are not part of a quest will be gender-indeterminate - but humans will always have some kind of gender-defining characteristic. There are exceptions, however, such as with [[ice troll]]s. A very few characters completely lack a gender, such as the [[Homunculus]].\n\nSeveral non-human [[boss]]es have a gender revealed by lore or their examine text — for example, [[Cerberus]] is referred to as \"her\" when in a [[Boss lair display]] and [[Kree'arra]] said he is male during the [[2014 Birthday event]]. Interestingly, [[Zulrah]] is referred to as \"him\" by the people of [[Zul-Andra]] and \"her\" in the [[Boss lair display]].\n\nThe [[Makeover Mage]] has the ability to change between genders whenever they want to, and do so randomly every few seconds.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}"}

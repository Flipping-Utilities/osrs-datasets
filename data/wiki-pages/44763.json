Most clothes are worn for aesthetic reasons only, although some items that may be considered clothes do offer defence bonuses (see below).\n\nPlayers define a default outfit for their character when they create their [[account]]s, which ensures that avatars never appear naked or in their underwear. Players can change their default outfit at any stage of the game by visiting [[Thessalia's Fine Clothes]] in [[Varrock]]. After completing [[The Fremennik Trials]], [[members]] can change their shoes by visiting [[Yrsa]] in [[Rellekka]]. Players can also change their clothing, wrists and shoes for free using a wardrobe in the [[bedroom]] of a [[POH]].\n\nMost [[non-player character]]s (NPCs) also wear clothes. All [[human]] NPCs do, but some other species may not, especially animals such as [[Ping]] and [[Pong]], who are [[penguin]]s. Most NPCs never change their clothes, with exceptions including [[Molly]], [[Sigmund]], and [[Zanik]].\n\nPlayers can obtain other clothing in the form of [[items]] that they can equip. These may replace the default outfit, or may be worn over the top. For example, a player's bare legs are visible when wearing [[shorts]], even if the default outfit includes long trousers. However, a [[stripy pirate shirt]] is a sleeveless garment that allows the sleeves of the default top to show.\n\nNovelty clothes may be given as a reward from [[random events]] (such as [[mime clothing]]) or from holiday events (such as [[bunny ears]]). These are likely to be non-tradeable, especially those from recent holiday events.\n\n==Clothes versus armour==\nSome players may consider [[armour]] to be a subset of clothes, whilst others may contend that clothes and armour are two distinct groups.\n\nIf clothes and armour are separate classifications then it may be sensible to define armour as garments that offer a [[Defence]] bonus. Clothes could then be defined as any garment that provides no Defence bonus.\n\nThis distinction would classify different parts of an outfit in separate categories. For example a [[Ham shirt]] would be classified as armour, and a [[Ham logo]] would be classified as clothes.\n\n==Clothing as a requirement==\nSome clothes are required to enter certain places. For example, players must be wearing a [[chef's hat]] to enter the [[Cooks' Guild]]. They must wear a [[brown apron]] to enter the [[Crafting Guild]].\n\nSome [[quests]] require the player to wear particular clothes, usually as a disguise. For example, players must be wearing [[H.A.M. robes]] for parts of [[Death to the Dorgeshuun]]. They must wear a [[desert disguise]] (composed of a [[Karidian headpiece]] and a [[fake beard]]) for part of [[The Feud]].\n\nPlayers may even be required to provide clothes as a disguise for [[non-player character]]s in quests. In Death to the Dorgeshuun, they must provide H.A.M. robes for [[Zanik]]. In [[Prince Ali Rescue]], they must provide a [[pink skirt]] for [[Prince Ali]].\n\n==Assistance in skills==\nSome [[skills]] are more easily trained whilst wearing certain clothes. For example, whilst picking the pockets of [[Humans Against Monsters|H.A.M.]] members to train [[Thieving]], wearing a complete set of [[H.A.M. robes]] means that the player has a greater chance of success. The manual confirms this: \"if you are wearing a full set of H.A.M robes, your chances of blending in and Thieving successfully will increase.\"\n\n==Significance==\n===Players===\n[[Clan]] members may prefer all to wear the same clothes, or at least one common item of clothing.

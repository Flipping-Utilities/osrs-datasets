During this time, favour gain within what was referred to as the biggest city in the game was half as fast, as the percentage gained for various activities was half of what it is today. In addition, the established lore was that the five Houses of Kourend are endlessly fighting for power after the death of their last king, thus gaining favour in one House while having favour in others would result in the loss of favour for those Houses.\n</p><p>Four days after Great Kourend's release, a <a href=\"/w/Update:Devblog_38_-_Zeah,_Deadman_Mode_and_Jad_2\" title=\"Update:Devblog 38 - Zeah, Deadman Mode and Jad 2\">Developer's Blog</a> was released in response to player feedback that gaining 100% in some Houses are less rewarding than other Houses.

In addition, changes were made to rebalance the average time spent to reach 100% favour.\n</p><p>The final change to favour gain was made with the release of <a href=\"/w/X_Marks_the_Spot\" title=\"X Marks the Spot\">X Marks the Spot</a> on 7 February 2019, which removed the mechanic of losing favour in one House while performing tasks for another, thus no longer requiring players to lock in their favour.

It is one of the three regions that make up the continent, the other two being the [[Kebos Lowlands]] and the Kingdom of [[Varlamore]].{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ed|url=https://twitter.com/JagexEd/status/1082677172962246657|date=8 January 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.is/N1ZuU|archivedate=29 May 2020|quote=[The Kebos Lowlands are] a separate region to Great Kourend and one of the three regions that make up the continent.}} One of the largest kingdoms in [[Gielinor]], it is larger than [[Misthalin]] and [[Asgarnia]] combined, and is similar in size to [[Kandarin]].\n\nDespite being called a kingdom, Great Kourend is actually a republic, currently ruled by the [[Kourend Council]], with the five houses of Great Kourend ruling over the kingdom's five cities: [[Arceuus]], [[Hosidius]], [[Port Piscarilius]], [[Lovakengj]], and [[Shayzien]]. Although the five Houses can rule over their city as they see fit, they must also enforce and obey the laws set out by the Kourend Council.{{CiteNPC|npc=Councillor Andrews|quote=The five houses of Kourend each have their own leader who rules over their city. The leaders of the individual houses must enforce and obey the laws set out by the Kourend Council, but can otherwise rule as they see fit.}} However, after the events of [[A Kingdom Divided]], Great Kourend is once again ruled by a monarchy.\n\nPlayers may earn [[favour]] with the five houses to earn various privileges with them. Great Kourend can be accessed via ship from [[Port Sarim]], and the region must have been visited at least once before players may use [[teleportation]] methods to it.\n\n==History==\n:''The following section uses date conventions different from conventional formats. The date convention in Great Kourend, according to [[Arceuus]] horologist [[Imerominia]], is to state the number of days and decades since the signing of the [[Royal Accord of Twill]]. For example, '''3,573 - 73''' is the 3,573rd day of the 73rd decade. For convenience, dates in this section will be followed by a conversion of the amount of years that has passed since an event. Decades with BA, short for \"Before Accord\", following them refers to the time before the Accord was signed.''\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Statue (King Rada I) location.png|thumb|upright|A statue of King Rada I, founder of Great Kourend.]]\nGreat Kourend was founded by refugees fleeing from the mainland during the [[God Wars]];{{CiteText|text=Imafore's betrayal|quote=[Great Kourend] was formed over a thousand years ago by settlers who had fled the God Wars.}} the exact date of this remains unknown. At the time, only [[Arceuus]], [[Port Piscarilius]] and [[Lovakengj]] existed, led by leaders of their respective houses; [[Hosidius]] and [[Shayzien]] were founded later during the [[Dragonkin Conflicts]] in the [[Fourth Age]] about 2,000 years ago.{{CiteNPC|npc=Imerominia|quote=Hosidius and Shayzien were the two cities founded during the Dragonkin Conflicts.}} Out of the five cities, only the founder of Shayzien is known: [[Camorra Shayzien]], a heroine who fought alongside [[Robert the Strong]], [[Tristan Corvo]] and [[Aivas]] during the Conflicts.\n\nDuring this time, the [[Shayzien Crypts]] were built, burying Camorra there. In the future, these crypts would host the tombs of the kings and queens of Great Kourend.\n\nIt was not until the 10th decade BA (''1,510 years ago'') that the five cities were united into the Kingdom of Great Kourend by [[King Rada I]]. Most of kingdom's history before the uniting of the five cities remains largely unknown, as they were lost during the Age of Strife in the 38th to 47th decades{{CiteNPC|npc=Amelia|quote=Most of our history was lost during Xeric's reign.}} (''1,030 years ago'').\n\nSometime during the reign of [[King Rada III]] from the 7th to 6th decade BA (''1,480 years ago''), the [[Tower of Magic]] was constructed.{{CiteNPC|npc=Pagida|quote=The Tower was constructed by King Rada III. We don't know exactly when, since dates were not recorded before the Twill Accord.}} The Tower has many powerful enchantments and traps, with many rooms and levels hidden from sight. It is assumed the Tower was used for magical experiments, as [[Lord Trobin Arceuus]] is currently using it for such a purpose.\n\n===The general of Zamorak===\nSometime during the [[God Wars]], before the arrival of refugees that would go on to found [[Arceuus]], [[Lovakengj]] and [[Port Piscarilius|Piscarilius]], [[Skotizo]], one of [[Zamorak]]'s generals, made his way to Zeah after betraying and decimating the expedition team by taking the power of an unknown artefact found within the [[Karamjan Temple]] for himself.{{CiteText|text=Malumac's journal|quote=...that's when our leader revealed his treachery, too late for us to stop it. He took the artefact from its pedestal and turned to face us. Before we could react, he launched a barrage of demonic magic towards us. Many were killed instantly.}} Here, he used the artefact to summon a large variety of monsters, creating what is known today as the [[Catacombs of Kourend]].{{CiteText|text=Mount Karuulm diary|author=Karuulm|quote=The arrival seems to be a demon of Zamorak, one in possession of an artefact I have never encountered. While the demon arrived alone, he has used this artefact to call upon a variety of creatures to his side.}} Some time after, the Catacombs were enchanted with powerful magic that prevents the monsters within from escaping.{{CiteNPC|npc=Kharedst's memoirs|quote=I know of the powerful magic that keeps them [the creatures] bound below [within the Catacombs].}}\n\nWhat happened to Skotizo after creating the Catacombs is not known, but he remains deep beneath the Catacombs to this day.\n\n===The Council of Elders===\nDuring the 6th decade BA (''1,470 years ago''), the families of the five houses rebelled against [[King Rada III]], and formed the [[Council of Elders]]. The Council used the chambers in the Tower of Magic as their meeting place, and governed Great Kourend for fifty years from the 5th - 1st decade BA (''1,460 years ago'').\n[[File:Hosidius.png|thumb|Hosidius is the provider of a majority the kingdom's food, and remains the largest city in Great Kourend today.]]\nSometime during the rule of the Council of Elders, a famine struck the kingdom. Five years after the famine began, [[Lord Ethrain Hosidius I|Lord Hosidius]] met with the Lords of the other four houses, coming to an agreement that half of each house's lands be granted to Hosidius in order to grow more crops to stop the famine.{{CiteText|text=Hosidius letter|author=Lord Ethrain Hosidius I|quote=Only yesterday did I meet with the lords of the other houses and we agreed in principle that all houses would offer half their land so we may farm more. Within six months we can have enough food to halt this famine.}}\n\nThe next day, he wrote [[Hosidius letter|a letter]] to the Council of Elders to, once more, grant this request as he had already done so multiple times before.{{CiteText|text=Hosidius letter|author=Lord Ethrain Hosidius I|quote=My most venerable Council, I beseech you to grant my request as mentioned in previous meetings at your chamber. We can grow enough food to extricate us from the famine we have experienced these last five years. However, I cannot do so without the appropriate amount of land.}} The request was granted, and the famine ends sometime after. Today, Hosidius remains the largest city in Great Kourend.\n\n===The Royal Accord of Twill===\nThe Council of Elders was disbanded during the 1st decade (''1,410 years ago'') after the lords of the five houses ([[Lord Ethrain Hosidius I|Ethrain Hosidius]], Seabry Shayzien, Ret Piscarilius, Solange Lovakengj and Bourath Arceuus) wrote the [[Royal Accord of Twill]], a document which detailed the transition of authority from the Council of Elders to the Royal Lords of the five houses.\n\nThe document detailed the rotation of succession between the Royal Lords of the five houses, with one Royal Lord becoming the [[Grand Lord]] of Great Kourend for one decade, and passing the office to the next Royal Lord. Thus, the Lord of Hosidius, henceforth known as Lord Hosidius I, ruled the kingdom for one decade. The next Royal Lord to rule was Lord Lovakengj I, then Lord Shayzien I, Lord Piscarilius I and Lord Arceuus I. After the rule of Lord Arceuus I, the cycle would repeat and Hosidius would have their Royal Lord rule Great Kourend.\n\n===The Long Winter===\nDuring the 2nd decade (''1,400 years ago''), the Winter Beast (now known today as the [[Wintertodt]]), an entity of unknown origin, ravaged the lands north of Great Kourend, causing them to experience perpetual winter, with livestock and crops freezing. The Winter Beast continued to ravage the [[Northern Tundras]] for another three decades, with the kingdom's attempts to subdue it unsuccessful.\n\nOn 1,778 - 5 (''1,360 years ago''), fearing the Winter Beast may eventually ravage Great Kourend, Lord Arceuus I ordered the construction of the [[Arceuus Library]],{{CiteText|text=Official Order of Construction|author=Lord Arceuus I|quote=It is with this in mind that I, Lord Arceuus, Ruler of Great Kourend, hereby order the construction of a library. A library filled with texts, documents and research from all of Great Kourend. The library shall be constructed here, within Arceuus, and enchanted with spells from our greatest mages to protect the contents from evil.}} filled with texts, documents and research from all cities, in order to preserve the history of Great Kourend. Meanwhile, the most important texts were stored in the [[Library Historical Archive]], a repurposed chamber of the [[Tower of Magic]], for further study and additional protection.\n\nOn 1,748 - 7 (''1,340 years ago''), a master Lovakengj smith named [[Dinh]] creates a plan to defeat the Winter Beast. Meeting with the Order of the Sacred Flame, Dinh believed that the roots of the Bruma tree, a magical tree lying within the heart of the [[Northern Tundras]], can emit the heat required to subdue the Winter Beast. Dinh proposed to construct a large prison in which to lure the Beast in, and seal it with a large set of doors made from various materials, including [[lovakite]] and bark from the Bruma tree, with enchantments placed by the Order.{{CiteText|text=Winter's End|quote=Dinh has constructed the doors to the prison from various metal compounds, including Lovakite, but they must be reinforced with Bruma bark and enchanted by the Order.}}\n[[File:Doors of Dinh.png|thumb|The [[Doors of Dinh]] continue to seal the Winter Beast to this day.]]\nWith Lord Lovakengj II approving of the plans, the prison's construction was completed 800 days later, with known casualties of sixteen Order members and two scouts. On 2,548 - 7, after five decades, the Winter Beast was successfully imprisoned and sealed behind the [[Doors of Dinh]],{{CiteText|text=Winter's End|quote=Rejoice! Our mission has succeeded. The beast has been contained! The Bruma tree burns bright in the night sky, warming the northern tundra and holding back the beast.}} with Lord Lovakengj II declaring the day as Winter's End.\n\n===Breaking of the Accord===\nThe cycle of succession continued until 1,048 - 13 (''1,280 years ago'') when Lord Shayzien III seized control of Great Kourend using the military under his command, and crowned himself king.{{CiteNPC|npc=Imerominia|quote=In the 13th decade, King Shayzien III seized control of Kourend using the military under his command.}} Writing the [[A Shayzien State|Royal Charter]], he abolished the Royal Accord and formed the State of Kourend, which would serve the monarchy, govern revenues and mobilise forces.\n\nOn 2,547 - 20 (''1,210 years ago''), King Shayzien VI married Enia Hosidius, the daughter of Lord Hosidius.{{CiteText|text=Royal Wedding Invitation|quote=The State Chamberlain is commanded by The King to invite Mr Hanson Piscarilius to the marriage of His Royal Highness King Shayzien VI with Miss Enia Hosidius at Shayzien Chapel on 2,547 - 20 at High Noon.}} Their son was crowned king four decades later (''1,170 years ago''), and took the name King Hosidius IV in order to distance the family from the breaking of the Royal Accord of Twill.{{CiteNPC|npc=Imerominia|quote=[The son of King Shayzien VI] took the name King Hosidius IV in an attempt to distance the family from the breaking of the Royal Accord of Twill.}} King Hosidius IV ruled for four decades, and his son, King Hosidius V, succeeded the throne and ruled until the early days of the 33rd decade (''1,080 years ago'').\n\n===The Great Expedition===\nIn the early days of the 33rd decade (''1,080 years ago''), King Shayzien VII took control of Great Kourend. During his reign, he was obsessed with the [[Dark Altar]], and had spent a large majority of his time in the [[Tower of Magic]] performing experiments on citizens he summoned. Here, he oversaw the construction of various new sections, presumably to conduct magical experiments.\n\nSeeking to expand the territory of Great Kourend, on 1,740 - 36 (''1,050 years ago''), he ordered an expedition to explore the [[Kebos Lowlands]] west of the kingdom. A team was assembled and surveyed the immediate area west of the kingdom in order to assess the danger and scope of the king's expedition.{{CiteText|text=The Great Expedition|quote=I have requested a team to survey the immediate area to the west. We will need this information to determine the level of danger and scope of the mission.}}\n\nThirty-three days later, the survey team returns, reporting findings of a mountain beyond the swamps of the region.{{CiteText|text=The Great Expedition|quote=The survey team reports findings of a mountain to the west of their encampment beyond a swampy area.}} King Shayzien VII then ordered to have the mountain as their main focus for the expedition, and assigned Magnus Rimor, a Shayzien commander and seasoned explorer, as the party leader.\n\nAfter a week of interviews, Magnus selected five more members for his expedition: Doctor Bev Crushim, Lieutenant Thomas Berlin, Sergeant Henno Garvie, Corporal Rytin Edshirt and Corporal Keith Jones. With the party assembled, King Shayzien VII approved of the expedition plans on 1,800 - 36, giving the party 250 days to ascend the mountain and return with details of their findings.{{CiteText|text=The Great Expedition|quote=King Shayzien VII has approved the expedition plans. 250 Days to ascend the western mountain and return with details of the findings.}}\n\nThe party never returned. Assuming the party perished in the field, the expedition was declared a failure;{{CiteNPC|npc=Phileas Rimor|quote=Alas, according to records, the party never returned and were declared to have perished in the field.}} the mountain would become known as Mount Quidamortem, meaning \"certain death\" in Latin. During this time, King Shayzien VII also ordered the construction of a prison in the Tower of Magic.\n[[File:Tale of the Righteous - cave temple.png|thumb|An ancient temple housing an unstable altar, constructed sometime after the Great Expedition and before Xeric's reign.]]\nHowever, a temple was constructed, presumably under the orders of King Shayzien VII, in a [[Quidamortem Cave|cave on the western side of the mountain]] sometime during the 37th decade (''1,040 years ago''). Within the temple, an unstable altar was created, giving off a similar power to the Dark Altar, while having the ability to amplify the true Dark Altar's powers, allowing it to reach areas it previously could not.{{CiteNPC|npc=Gnosi|quote=This [Unstable Altar], it seems to give off the same power as the Dark Altar. I believe this altar was created to amplify the power of the Dark Altar, allowing it to reach areas it previously couldn't.}}\n\nHere, the natives species of [[Lizard (Quidamortem)|lizards]] in the [[Kebos Lowlands]] were experimented on, creating creatures such as the [[Corrupt Lizardman]]. King Shayzien VII noted in a journal he wrote during this time mentioning compatible creatures in Quidamortem for mass production, suggesting he was creating the [[lizardmen]] as an army for Great Kourend.{{CiteNPC|npc=Phileas Rimor|quote='Quidamortem's creatures are compatible. The experimentation is proving successful and we will soon be ready to mass produce.'}} Records of the experiments that remain imply that the process involved a combination of the breeding of humans and lizard creatures using dark magic.\n\n===The Age of Strife===\n[[File:Xerician Statue.png|thumb|A weathered statue on [[Mount Quidamortem]] depicting an ancient Xerician priest, or possibly Xeric himself.]]\n{{Main|Xeric}}\n\nSometime during the late 37th decade, the Battle of the Concourse began. King Shayzien VII was eventually killed in the battle on 3,316 - 37, ambushed by his own army of Elder Warriors; however, his body was never recovered.\n\nA few days after the battle, [[Xeric]] appeared and was said to have had a similar appearance to Shayzien VII. It was quickly discovered that he had used the power of the [[Dark Altar]] and moved his spirit from his mortal body into an incorporeal one. With this newfound power, Xeric proceeded to kill the remaining leaders of the five houses, and claimed Great Kourend as his own, using the [[lizardmen]] army he had mass produced in [[Mount Quidamortem]] as his guards and enforcers. The lizardmen would sweep cities and farms, kidnapping people for his experiments.\n\nDuring Xeric's Age of Strife, many fled from Great Kourend, seeking refuge south-west of the kingdom, beyond the [[Kebos Lowlands]]. Here, the refugees founded the kingdom of [[Varlamore]].{{CiteText|text=Imafore's betrayal|quote=The Kingdom of Varlamore was formed in a very similar way to Kourend, by those fleeing the Age of Strife.}}\n\nAt the height of his reign in the 43rd decade (''980 years ago''), a resistance group called HAX (Humans Against Xeric) attempted to storm the [[Tower of Magic]] and defeat Xeric, but had failed, resulting in the loss of two hundred members.\n\n===King Byrne I===\n[[File:King Byrne I portrait.png|thumb|upright|A portrait depicting an artist's impression of King Byrne I.]]\nDuring 312 - 47 (''940 years ago''), Byrne, a farmer, witnessed a lizardman guard murder a child whilst working his farm. Outraged, he slaughtered the lizardman, with the entire town as witnesses. Urging the people to fight back, the people revolted, and within seven days, the lizardmen were outnumbered and driven [[Lizardman Settlement|beyond the kingdom]] in the [[Kebos Lowlands]]. During the revolt, the temple surrounding the Dark Altar was destroyed as well, weakening Xeric's power and forcing him into exile,{{CiteNPC|npc=Ektheme|quote=During the battle, the temple surrounding the Dark Altar was destroyed, weakening Xeric's power.}} travelling west to [[Mount Quidamortem]]. After the successful revolt against Xeric, Byrne was crowned King of Great Kourend on 339 - 47.\n\nDuring King Byrne I's rule, he established the Kourend [[Royal Guard]], as he felt that it was dangerous for the [[Shayzien House]] to have control over the [[Shayzien Army]],{{CiteNPC|npc=Commander Fullore|quote=The Royal Guard was established by King Byrne I. He felt that it was dangerous for Shayzien House to control the only military in the kingdom, so he decided to establish a small one of his own.}} the kingdom's only military, and also allowed people from other cities in Great Kourend to enlist in the Shayzien Army.{{CiteNPC|npc=Captain Bruce|quote=Well at one time only citizens of Shayzien could join the army. It wasn't until the reign of King Byrne I that people from other parts of the kingdom were allowed to enlist.}} King Byrne I would rule for three decades, with his son King Byrne II ruling for another three decades after his father.\n\n===The Ascent of Arceuus===\nDuring the reign of King Byrne II (''910 years ago''),{{CiteNPC|npc=Lord Trobin Arceuus|quote=It was a thousand years ago, during the time of King Byrne II. I went to my people and shared the secrets of immortality with them.}} [[Trobin Arceuus]] and his brother-in-law, travelled to [[Mount Karuulm]] to seek the [[Tasakaal]], a powerful race of golem-like creatures. Trobin's wife had become very ill, and he pleaded to them to help his dying wife.{{CiteNPC|npc=Tasakaal|quote=They came to us. Two of them. The brother and the husband. Her time was running out. They wanted to give her more.}} The Tasakaal then granted them the knowledge of immortality, saving his wife.\n\nHowever, Trobin used this knowledge and shared the secrets to the [[Citizens of Arceuus]], making them able to become immortal. While not all of them accepted immortality, those that did were granted new bodies to house their souls, which are sustained by the Dark Altar.{{CiteNPC|npc=Lord Trobin Arceuus|quote=Not all of [Arceuus] accepted this gift of course, as was their right. Those that did, were granted new bodies to house their souls. These bodies are sustained by the Dark Altar.}}\n\n===Queen Biyrene I===\nSometime during the reign of King Byrne II, he died of unknown causes, and his wife, Biyrene, was crowned as Queen Biyrene I, as their son, King Byrne III, was too young to rule the kingdom. During her reign in the 53rd decade (''880 years ago''), she took Lord Piscarilius, who was responsible for Great Kourend's spy network as Lord of Intelligence, as her consort, and birthed a daughter, Queen Biyrene II.\n\nOnce her son, King Byrne III, came of age, she unwillingly gave up the throne. Had the law of succession made by her late husband never existed, she would have not given up the throne for her son, wishing to finish the work for this kingdom that she had started.\n\nDuring King Byrne III's reign in the 54th decade (''870 years ago''), he was stabbed to death in his chamber by an assassin. As King Byrne III had not achieved anything of note during his reign, it is believed that the assassination was arranged by Lord Piscarilius through the spy network in order to return his wife to the throne.\n\nQueen Biyrene I would rule for another two decades before passing the throne to her daughter, Queen Biyrene II.\n\n===War of the Five Houses===\n[[File:Forthos Ruin.png|thumb|Forthos as it appears today after its destruction in the War of the Five Houses.]]\nDuring the 120th decade, [[King Agata IV]] was overthrown by the leaders of the five houses, {{CiteText|text=Shayzia military orders|quote=... all five of the leaders had agreed to the plan to depose the gluttonous King Agata IV.}} presumably due to his mismanagement of the kingdom that left it ravaged by famine.{{CitePostbag|issue=27|author=[[Jonathan]]|letter=4|quote=King Agata IV’s mismanagement left the kingdom ravaged by famine...}} With no one next in line to the throne, an alliance between the Lovakengj and Piscarilius House formed to murder Lord Shayzien,{{CiteText|text=Shayzia military orders|quote=It is with a heavy heart I must inform you of a great tragedy to befall our house.

It seems he has no desire to participate in this conflict, but I suspect he will soon be given no choice.}}\n\nThough the exact casualties are not known, the Hosidius House suffered massive casualties compared to the other Houses.{{CitePostbag|issue=27|author=[[Jonathan]]|letter=4|quote=Most young men and women were drafted into the houses’ personal armies during the war, and Hosidius did ''not'' fare well.}} In addition, structures that were known to have been destroyed include [[Shayzia Ruin|Shayzia]], once a castle belonging to the Shayzien House, and [[Forthos Ruin|Forthos]], the former seat of the Hosidius House.{{CiteNPC|npc=Martin Holt|quote=Forthos was the seat of the Hosidius family before it was destroyed in the War of the Five Houses.}}\n\nWhile the war was seen by some as a petty squabble{{CiteText|text=Bloody diary|quote=The war started from some petty squabble between the lords and ladies of the five Houses, and I do not regret leaving at all.}} and a war of pride between the houses,{{CiteText|text=Rose's note (A Kingdom Divided - 1){{!}}Rose's note|quote=Find a great ruin that has withered and died. A seat of power, lost in a war of pride.}} the war ultimately lasted from the 121st - 123rd decade (''200 to 180 years ago''), with [[Arceuus]] never participating in the war. Despite this, the conflict became known as the [[War of the Five Houses]].{{CiteNPC|npc=Sergeant Ricardo|quote=Apparently they [Arceuus] didn't even properly fight in the War of the Five Houses.

However, during the grand feast at his palace in [[Civitas illa Fortis]], he killed the royal family by poisoning their drinks,{{CiteNPC|npc=Imafore's betrayal|quote=He had the servants open a barrel of his finest Aldarin red. Then, he made a toast, to the royal family of Kourend... The entire royal family collapsed before the emperor who looked on with a smile on his face.}} prompting Great Kourend to declare war on Varlamore.\n\nThe war had ended sometime before or during the reign of King Kharedst III in the 132nd to 135th decade (''90 to 60 years ago''). In the hope of repairing the relationship between Great Kourend and Varlamore, which had been destroyed after the war, the King ordered an envoy be sent to Varlamore to transport the [[Royal Accord of Twill]] to be displayed in the Grand Museum of Civitas illa Fortis.{{CiteText|text=Varlamore envoy|quote=In the hope of repairing the relationship with Varlamore, King Kharedst III ordered an envoy be sent to the Shining Kingdom.

[Councillor Orson] wasn't lying. The poison they gave [Rose] irreversibly destroyed her mind.

Despite this, its people still refer to it as a kingdom.\n\nThe Council proceeded to rule over Great Kourend for twenty years.

Here, a hidden entrance to the basement results in the discovery of Rose and Councillor [[Liam Orson]], who had been taking care of her since she entered into a coma. Having been discovered, he confesses to the adventurer and Lydia that the Council conspired to kill King Kharedst IV, but that they did so out of necessity. Liam reveals that they remain in contact with the mage, who helped them kill the King to obtain potions to help treat Rose. The mage was discovered to be [[Xamphur]], [[Xeric]]'s closest comrade. After surviving an encounter with him, the adventurer discovers that Xamphur was the one who gave David the poison to kill the King,{{CiteNPC|npc=Xamphur|quote=Councillor Andrews isn't happy.

There is no cure. Someone else could make the potions, but all they do is prolong her suffering. This is no life for anyone. The truth is, Rose died long ago.

Even so, different religions began to develop in Great Kourend, such as the religions of [[Ralos]] and [[Ranul]], whose origins are traced back to the Temple to Ranul and Ralos, known today as the [[Forthos Dungeon]].

During this time, favour gain within what was referred to as the biggest city in the game was half as fast, as the percentage gained for various activities was half of what it is today. In addition, the established lore was that the five Houses of Kourend are endlessly fighting for power after the death of their last king, thus gaining favour in one House while having favour in others would result in the loss of favour for those Houses.\n\nFour days after Great Kourend's release, a [[Update:Devblog 38 - Zeah, Deadman Mode and Jad 2|Developer's Blog]] was released in response to player feedback that gaining 100% in some Houses are less rewarding than other Houses. The following additions passed the following [[Poll:Old School Content Poll 38: Jad II, Deadman & Zeah|poll]]:\n*Arceuus: Addition of thematic teleport spells to the [[Arceuus spellbook]] and the [[Resurrect Crops]] spell\n*Hosidius: Access to the [[Vinery]] as well as the [[farmer's outfit]] and [[seed box]] from [[Tithe Farm]]\n*Shayzien: The [[dragon warhammer]] as a drop from [[lizardman shaman]]s\n*Other: [[Graceful outfit]] recolours for each House of Kourend\n\nCriticism of the restrictive nature of the favour system was still evident after the release of the additional rewards; this was changed with the release of the [[Architectural Alliance]] miniquest on [[3 March]], which allowed players to lock in their favour in a House once they have reached 100%, making it possible to earn 100% favour in all Houses.\n\nFavour gain was further tweaked with the release of [[Client of Kourend]] on 20 April 2017, which rewarded 20% favour in a chosen House, and doubled favour gain in all Houses (the lore being that the word of Xeric's return has spread, and that the houses are now too busy to care about the player's loyalty).\n\nFurther balancing changes to favour gain was made with the release of [[Tale of the Righteous]] on 19 April 2018, which removed the doubled favour gain reward from completing Client of Kourend, now being the default rate of favour gain. In addition, changes were made to rebalance the average time spent to reach 100% favour.\n\nThe final change to favour gain was made with the release of [[X Marks the Spot]] on 7 February 2019, which removed the mechanic of losing favour in one House while performing tasks for another, thus no longer requiring players to lock in their favour. As a result, the [[Architectural Alliance]] miniquest now rewards an [[Antique lamp (Architectural Alliance)|antique lamp]].\n\n===Design criticism===\n[[File:Great Kourend map 3 March 2016.png|thumb|A map of Great Kourend on 3 March 2016.]]\nThough players criticisms with the design of the city (the unnatural 'square' geographic design of the city was the most common complaint) were prevalent ever since the release of Great Kourend, only minor adjustments were made throughout the months after its release, with the most major changes being done in [[Update:Architectural Alliance|an update]] on 3 March, which involved the addition of more scenery and clearer roads throughout the city and the change from a large clear field with the statue in the centre of the city to a large, tall monument. Despite these changes, the overall shape of the city did not change.\n\nOn 26 April, Reddit user ''GentleTractor'' created a post titled '''[https://archive.ph/NFe6N Zeah Redesigned]''', which addressed the design issues that players have had since its release. The post went viral and quickly gained the attention of [[Jagex Moderator]]s, with Mod Mat K leaving a comment in the post that although GentleTractor's map was \"very nicely designed\", and that they may well take a few ideas from it, there is difficulty in changing what is already there without impacting the growth of Old School RuneScape as a game and as a business investment.\n\nOn 4 May, a [[Update:May - The Month Ahead (2016)|Month Ahead newspost]] was released, revealing that the Old School Team will be releasing a [[Update:Dev Blog: Great Kourend Content|Developer's Blog]] the week after, aiming to add small to medium sized updates to fill out unused areas of the city:\n*[[Magic tablet]]s for [[Arceuus spellbook]] teleports - 12 May\n*[[Sand Crab]]s and the [[Bear Your Soul]] miniquest - 19 May\n*Hosidius [[fruit stall]]s and [[botanical pie]]s - 26 May\n*The [[Woodcutting Guild]] and the [[Lovakengj Minecart Network]] - 2 June\n*The [[Catacombs of Kourend]] and [[Arclight]] - 9 June\n*[[Skotizo]], The Archaic Demon - 16 June\n\nThe team then stated that later in the year, they will be making major design changes to Great Kourend, with a concept image showing their design goals, which was made with the help of GentleTractor.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"280\">\nGentleTractor original Zeah rework map.png|Reddit user ''GentleTractor'''s proposed redesign of [[Zeah]].\nMay - The Month Ahead (2016) (4).png|Jagex's Great Kourend redesign concept, made with the help of GentleTractor.\n</gallery>\n\n===Mod West's Redesign===\nAfter the release of the [[Wintertodt]] on [[8 September]], work on redesigning Great Kourend began, with Mod West spearheading the project. Seeking feedback from players throughout the entire redesign, he posted his progress on Reddit on a weekly basis:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=width:750px;\n!Image\n!Description\n|-\n|[[File:Great Kourend redesign progress 1.png|center|250px]]\n|Mod West's Great Kourend redesign concept.\n|-\n|[[File:Great Kourend redesign progress 2.png|center|250px]]\n|Update #2, which fleshes out the [[Northern Tundras]] with the addition of the [[Settlement Ruins]] and the [[Fishing Hamlet]] (initially named \"Destroyed Village\"), and adds [[Land's End]] and the [[Kourend Woodland]].\n|-\n|[[File:Great Kourend redesign progress 3.png|center|250px]]\n|Update #3, which replaces the centre of Great Kourend with [[Kourend Castle]] and adds a river that flows through [[Hosidius]]. [[Xeric's Look out]] is added as an actual location.\n|-\n|[[File:Great Kourend redesign progress 4.png|center|250px]]\n|Update #4, which shortened the Piscarilius pier, tweaks to the western end of the city (in preparation for the upcoming raid update) and changed the Hosidius coastline to appear more natural.\n|-\n|[[File:Great Kourend redesign progress 5.png|center|250px]]\n|Update #5, which relabeled Great Kourend as a kingdom rather than a city. In addition, the colour scheme of Arceuus was changed and a path was added to Lovakengj via Arceuus. Part of the [[Shayziens' Wall]] was added as well. Lastly, the graveyard south of Shayzien had railings added around it, and more graves were added to the western side of the city, with the graveyard being given a name: the [[Graveyard of Heroes]].\n|-\n|[[File:Great Kourend redesign progress 6.png|center|250px]]\n|Update #6, which replaced some paved roads with natural dirt roads in the southern part of Hosidius, and the [[Crabclaw Isle]] is added.\n|}\n\nSatisfied with the redesign, and needing to move on to mapping what would be [[Mount Quidamortem]] and the [[Chambers of Xeric]], the Great Kourend rework was released on 17 November 2016.\n\nIn honour of GentleTractor for pushing the redesign of Great Kourend, an [[ancient machinery]] (in reality, a tractor) was added by the [[windmill]] in Hosidius. In addition, a [[Knight of Varlamore|knight]] was added in the [[Kourend Castle]], who says he is from [[Varlamore]], a kingdom to the south-west that GentleTractor had included in his original post.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"280\">\nGreat Kourend map 8 September 2016.png|A map of Great Kourend on 8 September 2016, before Mod West's redesign.\nGreat Kourend map 17 November 2016.png|A map of Great Kourend on 17 November 2016, after Mod West's redesign.\n</gallery>\n\n===Quests and lore===\nUpon Zeah's release, there were no quests that took place within the continent. Furthermore, the only lore that was available to players about Great Kourend were found in the [[Arceuus Library]] as well as small snippets about the [[Wintertodt]] through dialogue with NPCs in the [[Wintertodt Camp]]. Though it named some important events in its history such as the creation of the [[Royal Accord of Twill]] and the death of King Shayzien VII, there was no solid chronological timeline that players could rely upon.\n[[File:Library Historical Archive.png|thumb|left|The Library Historical Archive, developed by Mod John C as a side project to expand the lore of Great Kourend.]]\nThe release of the [[Chambers of Xeric]] on [[5 January]] [[2017]] saw the addition of the [[Library Historical Archive]], which added lots of lore about the kingdom's history, the story of [[Xeric]] and a [[timeline]] of ruling powers. Within the archive were historians who when spoken to, would tell players about specific subjects, as well as historical texts preserved that players could read, such as the [[Official Order of Construction]] and [[The Great Expedition]]. In addition, the unique date convention used by the people of Great Kourend was added.\n\nOn 4 April, a revision was added to the [[Update:Dev Blog: Slayer & Dungeons|Slayer & Dungeons Developer's Blog]] proposing the addition of Great Kourend's first quest, developed by Mod Wolf: [[Client of Kourend]]. The quest, released on 20 April, revealed that [[Xeric]] was the client, who possessed [[Veos]], a treasure hunter and portmaster, to inform himself about the current state of the kingdom.\n[[File:Mod Ed.jpg|thumb|Mod Ed, who developed the Great Kourend storyline and standardised its lore and history.]]\nMod Ed, a Junior QA Analyst who had left after the release the Wintertodt due to having completed his summer internship, returned to work at Jagex on 20 April 2017 and was promoted to a Junior Content Developer on 31 July 2017. He would soon develop more quests to continue the [[Great Kourend quest series]] and set up the quest's storyline through a novice quest for each of the five cities:\n*[[The Queen of Thieves]] and [[The Depths of Despair]], quests involving the leaders of the Piscarilius and Hosidius Houses, were released together on 9 November 2017 as part of Mod Ed's personal projects. This update also retconned the identity of [[Veos' Client]], no longer being Xeric.\n*[[Tale of the Righteous]], a Shayzien quest about The Great Expedition was released on 19 April 2018.\n*[[The Forsaken Tower]] and [[The Ascent of Arceuus]], quests involving Lovakengj and Arceuus, were released together alongside the [[Kebos Lowlands]] on 10 January 2019.\n\nDuring development of the Kebos Lowlands, Mod Ed went through every possible dialogue and item in order to centralise the lore of Great Kourend and set a consistent timeline of the kingdom's history. The changes he made included the removal of the term \"Zeah\" from the game and the term \"House\" from the names of the five cities (now used to refer to the leaders of the cities), as well as changing the texts of many books that still referred to Great Kourend as a city two years after Mod West's rework.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Great Kourend was originally planned to be named \"Great Goureng\" by Mod Reach, who quickly changed the first and last letters after Mods Ash and Mat K pointed out its similarity to {{WP|Hermann Göring}} (or Goering), a notorious Nazi military leader.{{CiteGeneral|url=https://clips.twitch.tv/PlainObservantConsoleWutFace|title=Origin of the name Great Kourend|author=Dan|date=29 January 2020}}\n*The sigil of Great Kourend was designed by a player named ''Aaron Alluyn'', who submitted the winning submission as part of a competition ran by Mod Ghost, a senior graphics artist in the Old School RuneScape team{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ghost|url=https://twitter.com/Jagex_Ghost/status/697718987816333312|date=11 February 2016|archiveurl=https://archive.is/Y0VPR|archivedate=29 May 2020|quote=Thanks for all who took part in the Great Kourend Sigil Design Competition, here's our winning submission.

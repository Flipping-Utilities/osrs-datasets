Additionally you will be completing a variety of basic quests to bump up your skills. Now that you have teleports and graceful, you should be much more able to handle things on your own. As such, the guide will no longer be outlining every step in explicit detail. Instead the guide will just outline how to get the items, then you can complete the quest with the help of any other guides you wish. The Quest Helper plugin on Runelite is great for this as well as the quick guides on the wiki. You will also be more responsible for keeping a clean inventory by dropping old quest items. It is best practice to not drop them until you actually need the space though, as some items are reused from previous quests. \n</p><p><u>Always check that you have all the required items for a quest before trying to complete it.</u> Keep in mind that items that can be obtained during a quest often are not be listed in the guide.

This guide will not outline an exact method for this, but trust that it is a lot more clunky to setup than using the adamant arrow method (You need a light source, and buying bolts requires you to have your cash stack). Also, the maple shortbow with adamant arrows does more dps against the green dragons anyways.</li>\n<li>This guide intentially avoids completing <a href=\"/w/Dragon_Slayer_I\" title=\"Dragon Slayer I\">Dragon Slayer I</a> so that you cannot get dragon tasks later. Do not start or complete it to use the green dhide body, it is only a minor upgrade.</li>\n<li>It is a good idea to get some <a href=\"/w/Blighted_manta_ray\" title=\"Blighted manta ray\">blighted manta rays</a> from the Last Man Standing Shop. Dying at the altar with your bones really sets you back, and the looting bag gives you plenty of space.</li>\n<li>You only need 45 prayer since killing the dragons is rather slow with only 60 range. You can come back later with a higher range level, or just use other methods.</li>\n<li>Do not forget your fossils from before.

Feel free to forge your own path though! \n</p><p>For many, the next step forward will be to start on <a href=\"/w/Slayer\" title=\"Slayer\">Slayer</a> so that you can complete <a href=\"/w/Monkey_Madness_II\" title=\"Monkey Madness II\">Monkey Madness II</a> and grow your stats for <a href=\"/w/The_Gauntlet\" title=\"The Gauntlet\">The Gauntlet</a>. \n</p><p><u>Ancient Staff:</u> \n</p><p>Keep in mind that you cannot buy more than 1 ancient staff, and they are otherwise difficult to get. Don't alch or drop the staff. \n</p><p><u>The Gauntlet:</u> \n</p><p><a href=\"/w/The_Gauntlet\" title=\"The Gauntlet\">The Gauntlet</a> is very doable without <a href=\"/w/Rigor\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rigor\">Rigor</a> and <a href=\"/w/Augury\" title=\"Augury\">Augury</a>, even with lower stats. You may have to prep tier 2 armour though.\n</p><p>If you are already experienced then you can do 5:1 with Mage right away. If you are less experienced you could afk train your range to ~80 and use Mage/Range only. This allows you to get into <a href=\"/w/Corrupted_gauntlet\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Corrupted gauntlet\">Corrupted gauntlet</a> much sooner.\n</p><p><u>Konar:</u>\n</p><p>Using <a href=\"/w/Konar_quo_Maten\" title=\"Konar quo Maten\">Konar quo Maten</a> as a slayer master is very useful as her assignment list does not have many \"bad\" tasks if you have not started <a href=\"/w/Dragon_Slayer_I\" title=\"Dragon Slayer I\">Dragon Slayer I</a>. You will probably want to block <a href=\"/w/Black_demon\" title=\"Black demon\">Black demons</a> though.\n</p><p>She provides the most <a href=\"/w/Slayer_points\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Slayer points\">Slayer points</a>, is easy to get to from the <a href=\"/w/Battlefront_Teleport\" title=\"Battlefront Teleport\">Battlefront Teleport</a>, and the random locations she assigns is not so bad when using <a href=\"/w/Bones_to_Peaches\" title=\"Bones to Peaches\">Bones to Peaches</a> for sustain. The <a href=\"/w/Brimstone_key\" title=\"Brimstone key\">Brimstone key</a> drops also provide a bit of extra loot.\n</p><p><u>Prayer:</u>\n</p><p>You will want to train prayer to 70+ before getting too deep into The Gauntlet if you are using melee. \n</p><p>You can use the same method as before, but should get higher range from chins first. You could consider using better range weapons (magic shortbow, crystal bow, rune crossbow), but the requirements and cost of a death are higher.\n</p><p>The crystal bow is particularly effective over time if you invest in lowering the recharge fee. This is a solid idea if you got a lot of extra money from thieving earlier (and don't die in the wilderness much).\n</p><p>The melee setup in the <a href=\"/w/Ultimate_Ironman_Guide/Prayer\" title=\"Ultimate Ironman Guide/Prayer\">Ultimate Ironman Guide/Prayer</a> is also good, but does require a source of food to tank the dragons.  \n</p><p>Alternatively, keep in mind that technically the efficient way to train prayer is to do a lot of <a href=\"/w/Runecraft\" title=\"Runecraft\">Runecraft</a> and unlock <a href=\"/w/Wrath_rune\" title=\"Wrath rune\">Wrath runes</a> to use with <a href=\"/w/Sinister_Offering\" title=\"Sinister Offering\">Sinister Offering</a> or <a href=\"/w/Demonic_Offering\" title=\"Demonic Offering\">Demonic Offering</a>.  \n</p><p>This is very macro efficient, but requires an extremely large time investment to setup.  \n</p><p><u>Fire Cape:</u> \n</p>\n<ul><li>You can now complete the <a href=\"/w/Fight_Caves\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fight Caves\">Fight Caves</a> rather easily by obtaining a <a href=\"/w/Crystal_weapon_seed\" title=\"Crystal weapon seed\">Crystal weapon seed</a> from Last Man Standing and charging at the <a href=\"/w/Singing_bowl\" title=\"Singing bowl\">Singing bowl</a> into a <a href=\"/w/Crystal_bow\" title=\"Crystal bow\">Crystal bow</a>. You can get <a href=\"/w/Crystal_shard\" title=\"Crystal shard\">Crystal shards</a> many ways so choose your preferred method.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>The basic ranged gear from earlier should be good enough due to the good base stats on the crystal bow, but you could use <a href=\"/w/Black_dragonhide_armour\" title=\"Black dragonhide armour\">Black dragonhide armour</a> if you do crafting or <a href=\"/w/Void_Knight_equipment\" title=\"Void Knight equipment\">Void Knight equipment</a>.</li>\n<li>Keep in mind you will also want a crystal bow for the Monkey Madness 2 boss fight.</li></ul>\n<p><u>Recipe for Disaster:</u> \n</p>\n<ul><li>Get 70 <a href=\"/w/Cooking\" title=\"Cooking\">Cooking</a> before completing <a href=\"/w/Monkey_Madness_I\" title=\"Monkey Madness I\">Monkey Madness I</a> if you did not complete it earlier for experience so that you can complete <a href=\"/w/Recipe_for_Disaster/Freeing_King_Awowogei\" title=\"Recipe for Disaster/Freeing King Awowogei\">Recipe for Disaster/Freeing King Awowogei</a> right afterwards.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>It is tempting to obtain <a href=\"/w/Barrows_gloves\" title=\"Barrows gloves\">Barrows gloves</a> for the slayer grind, but most likely it is not worth doing so as completing <a href=\"/w/Dragon_Slayer_I\" title=\"Dragon Slayer I\">Dragon Slayer I</a> will allow you to receive dragon tasks. Just use <a href=\"/w/Rune_gloves\" title=\"Rune gloves\">Rune gloves</a> while you are getting started with <a href=\"/w/Slayer_points\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Slayer points\">Slayer points</a>.</li></ul>\n<p><u>Berserker ring:</u>\n</p><p>You can obtain a <a href=\"/w/Berserker_ring\" title=\"Berserker ring\">Berserker ring</a> using <a href=\"/w/Iban_Blast\" title=\"Iban Blast\">Iban Blast</a> or even <a href=\"/w/Fire_Bolt\" title=\"Fire Bolt\">Fire Bolt</a> with <a href=\"/w/Chaos_gauntlets\" title=\"Chaos gauntlets\">Chaos gauntlets</a> if you are short on money. You don't need amazing tank gear.  \n</p><p><u>Proselyte:</u>  \n</p><p><a href=\"/w/Proselyte_armour\" title=\"Proselyte armour\">Proselyte armour</a>, specifically the chest and legs, is very useful for slayer if you are camping <a href=\"/w/Protection_prayers\" title=\"Protection prayers\">Protection prayers</a> and/or <a href=\"/w/Piety\" title=\"Piety\">piety</a> during your tasks. If you did pickpocket a lot of master farmers for seeds, you likely have plenty of prayer potions.  \n</p><p><u>Obsidian legs:</u> \n</p><p>(Very optional) <a href=\"/w/Obsidian_platelegs\" title=\"Obsidian platelegs\">Obsidian platelegs</a> can be obtained by buying <a href=\"/w/Chaos_rune\" title=\"Chaos rune\">Chaos runes</a> and selling them at <a href=\"/w/TzHaar-Mej-Roh%27s_Rune_Store\" title=\"TzHaar-Mej-Roh&#39;s Rune Store\">TzHaar-Mej-Roh's Rune Store</a> with <a href=\"/w/Karamja_gloves_1\" title=\"Karamja gloves 1\">Karamja gloves 1</a>. This is a bit expensive (~1m), but they are the best storable melee legs. You will have to buy the whole set to store, but if you don't plan to use a bag slot for <a href=\"/w/Bandos_tassets\" title=\"Bandos tassets\">Bandos tassets</a> late game then you might as well get these early. Keep in mind that if you are camping prayers, then proselyte is going to be better.   \n</p><p><u>Clue Scrolls:</u> \n</p><p>There are a lot of good storable items that can be obtained from <a href=\"/w/Clue_scroll_(hard)\" title=\"Clue scroll (hard)\">Hard Clue scrolls</a>, but nothing is actually that vital to get. For range gear you will likely want to use <a href=\"/w/Crystal_armour\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Crystal armour\">Crystal armour</a> with the <a href=\"/w/Bow_of_faerdhinen\" title=\"Bow of faerdhinen\">Bow of faerdhinen</a>. <a href=\"/w/Blessed_d%27hide_boots\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Blessed d&#39;hide boots\">Blessed d'hide boots</a> are nice but not needed as <a href=\"/w/Shayzien_boots_(5)\" title=\"Shayzien boots (5)\">Shayzien boots (5)</a> grant only 3 fewer attack and are much easier to obtain.  \n</p><p><u>Chins:</u> \n</p><p>Once you complete Monkey Madness 2 you can catch <a href=\"/w/Red_chinchompa\" title=\"Red chinchompa\">Red chinchompas</a> in <a href=\"/w/Prifddinas\" title=\"Prifddinas\">Prifddinas</a> to grow your range rather fast. ~90 range should be fine, but higher does help if you don't mind hunting. \n</p><p><u>Bursting:</u> \n</p><p>Using <a href=\"/w/Ice_Burst\" title=\"Ice Burst\">Ice Burst</a> for slayer is reasonably doable if you complete the <a href=\"/w/Desert_Hard_Diary\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Desert Hard Diary\">Desert Hard Diary</a> to get the better <a href=\"/w/Camulet\" title=\"Camulet\">camulet</a> teleport. You want this diary anyway for making noted unfinished potions.  \n</p><p><u>Bones to Peaches:</u> \n</p><p>Using the <a href=\"/w/Bones_to_Peaches\" title=\"Bones to Peaches\">Bones to Peaches</a> spell unlocked early in the guide will make slayer much easier as it provides an easy way to get food.  \n</p><p><u>Fighter Torso:</u>  \n</p><p>You of course want to knock out a <a href=\"/w/Fighter_torso\" title=\"Fighter torso\">Fighter torso</a>. It only takes a few hours and is storable.   \n</p><p><u>Dragon Defender:</u>   \n</p><p>The <a href=\"/w/Dragon_defender\" title=\"Dragon defender\">dragon defender</a> is actually storable in a stash unit with a <a href=\"/w/Slayer_helmet\" title=\"Slayer helmet\">Slayer helmet</a> and <a href=\"/w/Dragon_battleaxe\" title=\"Dragon battleaxe\">Dragon battleaxe</a>. The Construction level is pretty high though.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notable_Alternatives\">Notable Alternatives</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/Ultimate_Ironman_Guide/Step-by-step_to_Prifddinas?section=39&amp;veaction=edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: Notable Alternatives\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/w/Ultimate_Ironman_Guide/Step-by-step_to_Prifddinas?action=edit&amp;section=39\" title=\"Edit section: Notable Alternatives\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"What_about_Wintertodt?\">What about Wintertodt?</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/Ultimate_Ironman_Guide/Step-by-step_to_Prifddinas?section=40&amp;veaction=edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: What about Wintertodt?\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/w/Ultimate_Ironman_Guide/Step-by-step_to_Prifddinas?action=edit&amp;section=40\" title=\"Edit section: What about Wintertodt?\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Many players will be surprised by the lack of <a href=\"/w/Wintertodt\" title=\"Wintertodt\">Wintertodt</a> early on. Conventional wisdom says that rushing early Wintertodt is efficient, but the reality is that for the majority of players it is a complete waste of time. As outlined in this guide, you can be very successful without spending 50+ hours at Wintertodt. Below will break down the reasoning for this.\n</p>\n<ul><li>First and foremost, the number 1 reason not to do Wintertodt is simply that <a href=\"/w/Firemaking\" title=\"Firemaking\">Firemaking</a> is effectively a useless skill past level 66 (The highest quest requirement) Past that, the only relevant requirement are the Kourend and Kandarin diaries, and a master clue step, which have very high other requirements to get first. This means that doing Wintertodt early is really only for the non-Firemaking xp and loot, which brings us to...</li>\n<li>The loot from Wintertodt sucks. It doesn't matter if you are maxed, the loot still sucks. Sure over the course of 50+ hours it adds up to something decent, but compared to other things you could do for that time it is abysmal.</li>\n<li>You can get <a href=\"/w/Construction\" title=\"Construction\">Construction</a> elsewhere. The primary reasoning for doing Wintertodt is really the Construction experience, but you can do other methods that are much faster. Having early Construction does not save you the 50 hours you would spend getting it at Wintertodt. Getting 70 Construction through oak contracts takes about 20 hours and is very cheap, while also giving woodcutting xp like Wintertodt. The <a href=\"/w/Fletching\" title=\"Fletching\">Fletching</a> xp is nice, but you can easily buy fletching later from <a href=\"/w/The_Gauntlet\" title=\"The Gauntlet\">Gauntlet</a> money.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"/w/Tome_of_fire\" title=\"Tome of fire\">Tome of fire</a> is not necessary, and will be dropped eventually. Tome of Fire is great early game, but it really falls off after most questing has been done. Especially now with the <a href=\"/w/Book_of_the_dead\" title=\"Book of the dead\">Book of the dead</a> acting as a re-obtainable mage offhand with teleports too. Similarly, all the extra loot will be difficult to use early on, and moving it in an out of the bag will take a lot of time for relatively little reward compared to just doing more streamlined methods down the line.</li>\n<li>Finally, you need to do the quests anyways. The majority of the time spent in this guide is just doing quests, and even if you do Wintertodt you still have to spend time on the quests. Having Construction early helps with teleports, but does not save 50 hours.</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Boneyard_Prayer\">Boneyard Prayer</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/Ultimate_Ironman_Guide/Step-by-step_to_Prifddinas?section=41&amp;veaction=edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: Boneyard Prayer\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/w/Ultimate_Ironman_Guide/Step-by-step_to_Prifddinas?action=edit&amp;section=41\" title=\"Edit section: Boneyard Prayer\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Players that are interested in an easier and safer early game can start their journey with a visit to the <a href=\"/w/Bone_Yard\" title=\"Bone Yard\">Bone Yard</a>, where they will collect <a href=\"/w/Big_bones\" title=\"Big bones\">Big bones</a>, then use them on the wilderness <a href=\"/w/Chaos_Altar_(Prayer)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Chaos Altar (Prayer)\">Chaos Altar</a> for 43 <a href=\"/w/Prayer\" title=\"Prayer\">Prayer</a>. This unlocks the <a href=\"/w/Protect_from_Melee\" title=\"Protect from Melee\">Protect from Melee</a> prayer right away. \n</p><p>Having protection from melee makes many quest bosses trivial, and heavily reduces the need for food. Additionally, gaining these total levels early will allow you to unlock a <a href=\"/w/Rune_pouch\" title=\"Rune pouch\">Rune pouch</a> a bit sooner.\n</p><p>The downside to this method is that it is a somewhat tedious ~3 hour grind right at the start of your account and some players might wish to jump into more active progress.\n</p><p>Overall doing this method doesn't really gain or lose much time in the long run. The slow xp rates are offset by the extra time gained by being able to easily move through difficult sections without food and ends up about even. \n</p><p>If you are not comfortable navigating the early game safely (for example if this is your first ironman account) then doing this method is highly recommended as dying can cost a lot of time on an UIM. \n</p><p><u>If you do this method here are some steps.</u>\n</p><p>1) Drop all of your items except your shrimp and bread.\n</p><p>2) <a href=\"/w/Clan_Wars\" title=\"Clan Wars\">Clan Wars</a> minigame teleport.\n</p><p>3) Exit the <a href=\"/w/Ferox_Enclave\" title=\"Ferox Enclave\">Ferox Enclave</a> and head north east to the <a href=\"/w/Bone_Yard\" title=\"Bone Yard\">Bone Yard</a>\n</p><p>4) Pick up the <a href=\"/w/Big_bones\" title=\"Big bones\">Big bones</a> spawn at the south west end. Avoid the skeletons, they will attack you.\n</p><p>5) Hop worlds and pick up big bones until you have a full inventory.\n</p><p>6) Head north then west to the <a href=\"/w/Chaos_Temple_(hut)\" title=\"Chaos Temple (hut)\">Chaos Altar</a>. \n</p><p>7) Use your big bones on the altar.\n</p><p>8) Return to the boneyard for more bones. Repeat this until you have 43 prayer. \n</p><p>9) On your last trip of bones, grab a few <a href=\"/w/Iron_scimitar\" title=\"Iron scimitar\">Iron scimitars</a> from the spawn next to the big bones. \n</p><p>10) When finished, return to the Ferox Enclave, restore your run to full at the pool, and Lumbridge home teleport.\n</p><p>11) Sell your iron scimitars at the general store, then proceed with the guide from there. \n</p><p>Note that you don't have a many prayer points, so it is best to utilize <a href=\"/w/Prayer_Flicking\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Prayer Flicking\">Prayer Flicking</a> to extend your points further.\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mediawiki‐7bfb498f95‐7nv7j\nCached time: 20220511071013\nCache expiry: 86400\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: []\n[SMW] In‐text annotation parser time: 0.001 seconds\nCPU time usage: 0.433 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.521 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 1420/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 102989/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 66222/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 7/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0/100\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nLua time usage: 0.113/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 2012500/367001600 bytes\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%  198.975      1 -total\n 58.57%  116.538      2 Template:Equipment\n 25.88%   51.500     28 Template:Checklist\n 19.91%   39.621     28 Template:Ctg\n 11.04%   21.976     10 Template:Inventory\n  2.40%    4.768      2 Template:Fairycode\n  2.10%    4.179      1 Template:Cleanup\n  1.04%    2.069      1 Template:MessageBox\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key en_osrswiki:pcache:idhash:333038-0!canonical and timestamp 20220511071012 and revision id 14284497.

Completing this quest allows access to the city of [[Prifddinas]] which has many extremely useful features such as [[The Gauntlet]], [[carnivorous chinchompa|carnivorous chinchompas]], a [[sawmill]], [[shops]], [[Zalcano]], [[soft clay rock|Soft clay rocks]], a [[Portal (Player-owned house)|house portal]] with [[respawn]] location nearby, and more. These benefits, along with the significant skill requirements of the quest, make completion of Song of the Elves a significant milestone for any Ultimate Ironman account and will leave the player with a solid foundation moving forward.  \n\n;Some general notes on the guide\n* This is not an efficient maxing guide. Unnecessarily long grinds are avoided. \n* The guide does not visit [[Wintertodt]] early on as it is not worthwhile if you do not plan to max. This is explained in the [[Ultimate Ironman Guide/Step-by-step to Prifddinas#Notable Alternatives|Notable Alternatives]] section.\n\n* Players are welcome to deviate from the guide path as they wish. \n* Additional resources, such as method videos, are provided in the '''[[Talk:{{PAGENAME}}|talk page]]''' and will not be linked in the main article.\n\n'''If you have feedback or suggestions, head over to the [[Talk:{{PAGENAME}}|talk page]] and share them!'''\n\n==Route overview==\nThis section provides a general overview of the route to give you an idea of where things are heading.\n\n# <u>[[#Getting_started|Getting started]]:</u> This section takes the player from [[Tutorial Island]] through the start of [[Agility]] and utilises multi-questing to prevent wasting time walking without teleports.\n# <u>[[#Agility|Agility]]:</u> You will be training Agility on rooftop courses for the full [[Graceful outfit|graceful outfit]], then at the [[Agility Pyramid]] for money until level 70.

You now have your feet on the ground and are ready to start playing the game! Which of course means running around in circles mindlessly watching numbers go up for hours.\n\nThis grind is long, but will provide cash to get your account going. This is the best option for money since you want these Agility levels for Song of the Elves anyway. \n\nIf you want a break from this grind at any point, there are several good afk options. Fishing in barbarian village is a solid choice for easy total levels (needed for a [[Rune pouch]]) and you can cook on the fire there.   \n\nFishing isn't directly needed for this guide, but does benefit your account in the long run.   \n\nBe careful about getting too sidetracked though. This agility is very helpful and will pay off greatly.   {{Checklist|*Do [[Varrock Rooftop Course]] course until 40 Agility.\n* Buy an [[adamant sword]] from the [[Varrock Swordshop]].\n*Complete [[Priest in Peril]].

Drop your runes and anything else you are holding on to in your inventory other than coins.\n*Home teleport to Lumbridge and head to Shantay Pass.\n*Buy waterskins(4) and a shantay pass. Leave 8 slots open for wine.\n*Head into the desert, take the carpet to [[Pollnivneach]], then fill your inventory with wine from the guy in the pub.\n*Take the carpet to [[Nardah]] and head west to the [[Agility Pyramid]].\n*Do Agility Pyramid until you reach 70 Agility.\n**When you need supplies walk to Nardah, take the carpet to Pollnivneach, buy waterskins from the general store, and wines in the bar. Adjust your waterskin/wine ratio as you level up.|title=}}\n\nAfter getting to 70 Agility you should end up with at least 1.5m. This will last a while, but you will need to make more later from [[Thieving]]. You have 2 main options for that, and which you want to do impacts your choices now.\n\n* If you don't mind [[Blackjacking]], then just move on with your 1.5m. This should last until you get the [[Rouge outfit|Rogue outfit]] and you can blackjack for all the extra money you need.\n* If you want to do [[Ardougne knight|Ardougne knights]], then staying at the pyramid a bit longer until you have 2m makes it much more likely you will last until you can complete the [[Ardougne Medium|Ardougne Medium diary]].\n\nIf you do happen to run out of money before you unlock the thieving method you prefer, just come back to the pyramid for a bit. It doesn't take too long to get there, and you don't need a completely clean inventory.  \n\n===Magic===\nNow it is time to work on [[Magic]]. The goal is to unlock teleports around the world so that you don't have to walk everywhere.\n\nFirst you need to unlock [[Ali's Discount Wares.]] You could buy your runes at the [[Lundail's Arena-side Rune Shop.|deep wilderness rune shop]] for less money, but it is a risk going there. Also you want to unlock Ali for later anyways.  {{Checklist|*Clean out the waterskins and wines from your inventory. You should just have coins now, wearing your graceful.\n*Chronicle teleport to Varrock and buy a fire staff, 200 mind and 400 air runes.\n*Home Teleport. Walk to Port Sarim.

If you don't get there then buy some law runes and do the telekinetic room until you get 55 Magic.  \n\nIf you run out of runes for some reason, just buy more. Keep any extra law and nature runes, use up any extra cosmics.\n\n'''Leave yourself 1 extra telekinetic, 1 alchemist, 1 Graveyard, and 15 Enchantment points.''' (You will want a mud rune later).\n\n==== Rune Pouch ====\nYou should obtain a rune pouch as soon as you get the required 750 total level. You do not need to go out of your way to get totals levels though as the guide will get 750 total eventually. \n\nNot having the rune pouch may cause a few minor inconveniences since the guide steps were written before this level requirement was added. If you run into any significant space issues, please provide a short comment in the talk page, or edit the steps yourself to fix the issue. {{Checklist|*Clan wars teleport and do [[Last Man Standing]] until you can purchase a [[rune pouch]]. Given the current state of Last Man Standing (Bots everywhere) you should go into each game and try to win the first fight. If you win, hide/run until there are 9 people remaining then suicide. This gives 2 points per fight you win. It is not worth trying to win the match as you will eventually run into an overpowered bot almost every game. If at any point you fight a bot, just let it kill you and report it, it isn't worth the time to fight it.\n**Even if you hate PvP, the rune pouch is an extremely important item for Ultimate Ironman that you will need eventually. The only other option for it is [[Slayer points]] boosting, which would be difficult this early in your account (You can't use the high level [[Slayer master]]s for points). \n\n*(Optional but recommended): Now that you have 55 Magic, you can do also do Last Man Standing for [[rune arrow]]s to [[high level alchemy]] as you quest. This guide involves a lot of time walking, so this gives you something to do. How efficient doing this is depends on how many points you can get per hour. If you can get at least 15 points an hour, then this is a great way to make some extra cash and work on Magic xp (you need level 82 eventually). The guide will not be reminding you to do this, so it is on you.|title=}}\n\n===Questing for Farming===\nThe skilling break is over and it is time to head back to questing! The focus for now will be to grow your [[Farming]] level to complete [[Enlightened Journey]], without actually having to farm anything. Additionally you will be completing a variety of basic quests to bump up your skills. Now that you have teleports and graceful, you should be much more able to handle things on your own. As such, the guide will no longer be outlining every step in explicit detail. Instead the guide will just outline how to get the items, then you can complete the quest with the help of any other guides you wish. The Quest Helper plugin on Runelite is great for this as well as the quick guides on the wiki. You will also be more responsible for keeping a clean inventory by dropping old quest items. It is best practice to not drop them until you actually need the space though, as some items are reused from previous quests. \n\n<u>Always check that you have all the required items for a quest before trying to complete it.</u> Keep in mind that items that can be obtained during a quest often are not be listed in the guide. If you do not have the required items/stats for a quest when the guide asks you to do it please provide feedback in Discussion at the top left of this page! \n\n====Getting a house and doing some basic quests====\n{{Checklist|*Buy 300 law runes, 1500 air runes, 500 water, 500 earth, and 500 mind runes.

The others are all obtainable, but some are rather annoying to get.\n***If you do have to get a nature talisman, the most viable option is to do [[Enter the Abyss]] and kill the [[abyssal leech]]s. There is a safespot for them at a specific part of the [[Abyss]]. Killing them is extremely difficult though as getting into the safespot is very hard with our current stats, and if you die there it will be difficult to get your items back. It is worthwhile to simply go off the guide path and get 43 Prayer now. Safespot [[blue dragons]] with fire strike then use the bones on the [[Chaos Altar (Prayer)|wilderness altar]]. Death pile your items to be safe when using the bones. This is a slow, but vastly better than wiping in the abyss. Note that you can also change your respawn location to Falador. You will also need to get some sort of prayer restoration since the Abyss drains your prayer. Starting [[Zogre flesh eaters]] is quick ways to get this.

Protect it with the apples. It is smart to plant it at Taverley for future willow log supply.\n*Clean out your inventory if you have anything.

Put them on Herblore.\n**You should be level 20 Herblore, but if you are short somehow doing [[Jungle Potion]] should get you there.\n*Clean finds in the Varrock Museum until you get all 50 Kudos.\n*Kill [[chaos druid]]s for a [[marrentil]].\n*Buy 2 [[vodka]] from [[Heckel Funch]] in the Grand Tree.\n*Complete [[Bone Voyage]].}}\n\n====Ammonite Crabs====\n{{Checklist|*Put your graceful outfit in your costume room.\n*Buy a [[studded body]] and [[studded chaps]] from [[Horvik]].\n*Buy a [[coif]], [[green d'hide chaps]], and [[green d'hide vambs]] from the Champions' Guild shop.\n*Get an [[Ava's Attractor]] from Ava if you don't still have it.\n*Buy a [[Dorgeshuun crossbow]] and 10k [[bone bolt]]s to start out. Get more later if needed.\n**(Optional) If you are good at Last Man Standing (~20+ points an hour) then you can save a bit of time by buying adamant arrows and using a maple shortbow.\n*Buy a lot of hops seeds from [[Olivia]] in Draynor Village. You could also thieve them from Master farmers if you want to go out of your way for that. Keep in mind you don't want to clog up your inventory with seeds until after prayer, so don't go too crazy at master farmers yet.\n**How many you get will depend on how actively you think you will do birdhouse runs.\n*Get a hammer and chisel.\n*Buy 4 iron and 8 coal at the blast furnace, then smith 4 steel bars.\n*Make 4 [[clockwork]] in your house.\n**If you didn't make a crafting bench earlier make one now.\n*Buy an axe or get one from tree spirits.\n*Chop some logs and oak logs for birdhouses. \n*Go to Fossil Island and kill [[ammonite crab]]s for range xp. Your range gear is basic, but since the crabs have no defense it doesn't really matter.\n**Do birdhouse runs whenever you can. You will have to manage getting higher level logs as needed (You will need to teleport out and come back). \n***When you need higher crafting you can make molten glass in Port Phasmatys. You can death storage at [[Volcanic mine]] once you have some [[numlite]]. 61 Crafting is a good goal for [[Lunar Diplomacy]] later on. \n***You can make some [[Digsite pendant]]s if you want. Rubies can be bought in Ardougne.\n***You can farm any seeds you want as you get them. You will have to balance what seeds you keep vs how many spaces you leave open. \n****If you don't want to drop some higher level seeds, then you could do [[Tithe Farm]] now so you can use them. Also it is notable to keep in mind that you will be doing more birdhouses a bit later when you train melee at ammonite crabs. This may influence how much farming you want to do right now. \n**If you want to put in extra effort, you can actually alch while killing the crabs for very efficient magic xp. \n**At level 40 wear your green dhide chaps and vambs.\n**At level 50 go upgrade your Avas to an [[Ava's accumulator]].\n**Setup Runelite to notify you on any [[fossil]] drops. When you fill up on fossils put them in the [[fossil storage]] on the north side of the island.\n*Do this until level 60 Ranged as that is required for quests later.\n**If you would like, you are more than welcome to continue training here longer. Going until 70 range would be a good goal. The extra fossil drops will help you with early herblore and prayer experience, as well as provide more time to do birdhouse runs. }}\nIt is not worth doing [[Slayer]] with range right now as the experience will just not be fast enough to warrant it over doing melee Slayer later.\n\nGetting 60 range gives you good damage against the green dragons, but you don't want to get much higher than this because you can train better using [[Carnivorous chinchompa|Carnivorous chinchompas]] later.\n\n===Prayer===\nIt is time to train Prayer finally! You will be killing [[green dragon]]s and using the bones on the wilderness [[Chaos Altar (Prayer)|Chaos Altar]]. \n\nIf you decided to get 43 prayer at the start of your account then you could optionally skip this section. Just make sure to have 45 prayer by the end of the guide for the [[Fragment of Seren]] fight (You want to have [[Mystic Might]]). \n\nClean up your inventory. Drop your water runes, book, dramen staff, games necklace, and ring of dueling. Also drop your birdhouse supplies and any seeds you are not keeping.\n{{Checklist|*Get a dwarven rock cake and cool it.\n*Buy 500 fire runes, then drop the fire staff (Not technically needed, but makes things a bit simpler).\n*Do Last Man Standing until you have a stockpile of points. 20 points should be fine for now and you can do more as needed.\n*Store all but 200k coins in the coffers by Last Man Standing. This prevents you from losing all your money to a disconnection. Get more money out as needed.}}\nYour inventory should look like this with nothing equipped. (The rune pouch has air, earth, and law runes).\n{{Inventory|Dwarven rock cake|coins|Fire rune|Rune pouch|align=right}}\n\nThe full method is on the [[Ultimate Ironman Guide/Prayer]]. It is the one about killing green dragons without the wilderness diary and involves using range with a maple shortbow.{{Checklist|*Do this method until at least 45 prayer, but you could go higher.\n**If you would like, you could also do the blue dragons method mentioned on the page, but the rune cost is rather significant for this stage in your account, and is slower Prayer xp (unless you die a lot at green dragons).\n**This method does not require that many Last Man Standing points, but if you really really don't want to do Last Man Standing then you could use a Dorgeshuun crossbow instead. This guide will not outline an exact method for this, but trust that it is a lot more clunky to setup than using the adamant arrow method (You need a light source, and buying bolts requires you to have your cash stack). Also, the maple shortbow with adamant arrows does more dps against the green dragons anyways.\n**This guide intentially avoids completing [[Dragon Slayer I]] so that you cannot get dragon tasks later. Do not start or complete it to use the green dhide body, it is only a minor upgrade.\n**It is a good idea to get some [[blighted manta ray]]s from the Last Man Standing Shop. Dying at the altar with your bones really sets you back, and the looting bag gives you plenty of space.\n**You only need 45 prayer since killing the dragons is rather slow with only 60 range. You can come back later with a higher range level, or just use other methods. \n**Do not forget your fossils from before. You should turn them in for herblore xp lamps, but if you happen to have extras then you can use them for prayer xp.}}\n\n===Herblore and required quests===\nIt is time to keep questing to get past the early Herblore levels without having to make potions. You will also be rounding out the last few quests needed for Song of the Elves and [[Desert Treasure]].\n\nAlso by this point the guide is going to assume you can figure out how to get required quest items on your own. The process is the same as you have been doing this whole guide.\n\n====Herblore and Elf quests====\n{{Checklist|*Drop all your range gear.\n*Go get a Dramen staff again.\n*Get your Graceful outfit, fire staff, mind and water runes back.\n*Also make a new Ring of dueling and Games necklace. Ready to quest again!\n*You can go back to alching if you want. Inventory is tight for [[Death Plateau]] though so maybe wait until after that.\n*The guide assumes you restore your prayer after every quest.\n*Get a [[fly fishing rod]] and some bait/feathers. Fly fish in Barbarian Village and cook the trout until you have 10 [[trout]]. Drop the rod and feathers.\n*Get some iron ore from the Blast Furnace and make an iron bar. Superheat if you have nature runes.\n*Buy 10 bread from the baker in Ardougne.\n*Buy a [[Premade blurb' sp]] from the Gnome Stronghold.\n*Complete [[Death Plateau]].\n**Drop your mind/water runes for a bit when you need the extra space.\n*Get a few cakes for food to be safe for the next quest.\n*Complete [[Troll Stronghold]].\n*Get:\n**50 death runes so you can use some blast spells.\n** Some extra cakes if you are low on food.\n** A tinderbox.\n** An axe.\n** A hammer.\n** 2 ashes.\n*Take fairy ring {{fairycode|BIP}}, then head to [[Morton]] and complete [[Shades of Mort'ton]].\n**Remember you can get the [[tarromin]]s at the start of the quest from searching the table.\n**Pray melee helps here, hope people on world 377 can help you with the temple.\n*Clean up your inventory again, get a few more cakes if needed.\n*Do [[Jungle Potion]] (Fairy Ring CKR).\n**Safespot a [[jogre]] while you are there for the diary.\n*Get a few more cakes if needed, then buy 100 chaos runes.\n*Complete [[Zogre Flesh Eaters]]. [[crumble undead]] the boss and enemy.\n**Your house is in Yanille. Restore stats at clan wars if you need before the boss.\n*Complete the [[Karamja easy diary]]. Use the lamp on Herblore.\n*You should now have at least 30 Herblore without having to do any actual training. This is a big milestone, as you can now put a lot more choice rewards into it. If you have been very unlucky on random event xp and are not 30 Herblore then you may need to kill a few chaos druids or something to make potions. You can't be more than ~1k xp short though if you did all the right choice xp and quests.\n*Complete the [[Ardougne easy diary]] and use the lamp on Herblore.\n*Complete [[Shilo Village]].\n*Complete [[One Small Favour]] (use both lamps on Herblore).\n**If you get a [[ranarr weed]] while getting the other herbs, keep it.\n*Complete [[Eadgar's Ruse]].\n*Complete [[Underground Pass]].\n**High Alch the Iban's Staff for 25k.\n** Alternatively, spend 200k to upgrade the staff and complete the Medium Ardougne task. If you destroy the staff, you will have to pay 200k to re-buy it and then another 200k to upgrade. The upgraded staff alchs for 51k.\n*Complete [[Regicide]].\n*Complete [[Watchtower]].\n*Complete [[My Arm's Big Adventure]].\n*Get 61 Crafting. [[Ultimate Ironman Guide/Crafting]] if you have not already. If your inventory is full you can death storage at the [[Nightmare]] boss.\n*(Optional), If you want to thieve [[Ardougne knight]]s rather than blackjack, you can go out of your way to complete the [[Ardougne medium diary]] now.}}\n\n====Melee stats for Roving Elves====\nIt is a good time to knock out some melee stats. The only reason to do this is so that you can actually kill the moss giant in the [[Roving Elves]] quest.\n\nIt is not recommended to go all out getting a full melee setup at this time, as you will end up spending more time getting them with low stats than they will actually save.{{Checklist|* (Optional) Complete all the [[Recipe for Disaster]] subquests except [[Sir Amik Varze]] and [[King Awowogei]].\n*(Optional) Complete [[Monkey Madness I]] for a large amount of combat experience. \n**You could even go out of your way to get 70 cooking and do the monkey section of Recipe for Disaster at the same time, as it is much easier to do them together.\n**This will require a bit of skilling to do right now, but not a ton.\n*Make a [[Strength amulet]]. \n*Kill [[Zamorak warrior]]s for a [[Rune scimitar]], or just buy a [[Rune sword]] at the Champions' Guild.\n*Buy some [[climbing boots]].\n*Buy your best Recipe for Disaster gloves.\n*Kill ammonite crabs with melee until 55 [[Strength]], 60 [[Attack]], and 45 [[Defense]]. This will hopefully be enough to kill the moss giant and sets you up nicely with 60 Attack when you do finally get to melee later.\n**Again, do birdhouse runs as you can.\n**Save a few maple, yew, and magic tree seeds in your looting bag for farming contracts later. \n*Complete [[Roving Elves]]. \n**Make some rings of recoil and use your strength amulet for boss.\n**Buy some [[Karambwan]]s from [[Brimhaven]] for food.\n**Flinch the moss giant as needed.\n**You may want to keep the weapon seed, but it isn't too big of a deal as you can get one from Last Man Standing later.}}<u>A note on melee training:</u> It is very tempting to get a [[Dragon scimitar]], and start down the melee route now. You really don't need to though, just be patient.\n\nThe Dragon scimitar specifically is actually a pain to get back if you have to alch it, as you have to reobtain the [[M'speak amulet|monkeyspeak amulet]] and [[Monkey talisman|talisman]]. Additionally, you will want a [[Berserker ring]] and [[fire cape]], but you are not setup for those yet.\n\nIf you get a [[Dragon defender]], you will be stuck with an untradeable item in your off-hand slot that you didn't need to get this early. \n\nJust wait until after you finish Song of the Elves before getting too heavy into melee.\n\n===Song of the Elves skill requirements===\nYou are now ready to get on the skilling grind! There are a few quests left before Song of the Elves itself, but all of them have reasons to wait until after the skilling grinds are done. \n\nSong of the Elves Requires:\n* 70 [[Agility]] (Already obtained).\n* 70 [[Farming]]\n* 70 [[Herblore]]\n* 70 [[Construction]]\n* 70 [[Hunter]]\n* 70 [[Mining]]\n* 70 [[Woodcutting]]\n* 70 [[Smithing]]\n* 82 [[Magic]] (Seren fight)\n\nBelow is a good order to do these in, but you can do it however you like. It is recommended to get your herb seeds sorted out first so that you can farm as you do the other skills.\n\n====Farming====\nFarming is pretty straightforward.\n{{Checklist|*Do [[Tithe Farm]] until level 65. Then medium contracts and birdhouses will get you to at least 70.\n**If you are not 34 Farming, buy some plants in Falador and use them in your house to knock out the last bit of xp to get 34.\n**Going all the way to 85 Farming at Tithe Farm is an option as it unlocks hard contracts at the Farming guild. This will also increase the loot from master farmers.\n**A compromise would be to get 82 farming, and use garden pies from the cooking guild to boost to do hard contracts. You will have to wear a [[chef's hat]] to get into the cooking guild.}}\n\n====Herblore====\nHerblore is the slowest and most complicated skill as an Ultimate Ironman, but you will want to get started relatively early so that you can do the other skilling grinds while you farm.\n\n<u>Getting set up:</u>\n\n{{Checklist|*Get 65/85 farming at Tithe farm first.\n*Clean out your inventory to just your rune pouch (Air, earth, law), fire staff, water runes, coins.\n*Get 1020 noted [[pineapple]]s from Brimhaven.\n**Buy them at charters, note at the farming patch.\n*Buy a seed box from Tithe Farm.\n*Get a [[Kharedst's memoirs]] again and wear it if you don't have it. This will be your Hosidius teleport for Farming.\n*Get a [[rune pickaxe]] from a shop.\n*Mine 1700 [[volcanic ash]]. Once done you can alch the pickaxe.\n*Go to each [[compost bin]] around the world you have access to and fill them with pineapples. When they are done you can come back to harvest them .\n**Use the volcanic ash on the bin before harvesting the compost.\n**You will want to get moving on this even though you don't have herb seeds yet so that you can clear up the 2 inventory slots for pineapples and volcanic ash.\n**Keep 15 inventory slots open until you are done making compost.\n*Put up your graceful, get out your rogues set.\n*Move your house to Pollnivneach if you plan to blackjack.\n*Drop your water runes (They won't be needed since you have an Ardougne portal in your house).\n*Go to the [[Farming Guild]].\n**[[Battlefront teleport]] in your house takes you nearby.}}\n<u>Storing up herb seeds:</u>\n\nAt this point you will be working to stock up on a large amount of herb seeds by completing medium level [[Farming contract]]s and thieving [[Master Farmer]]s.\n\nThis section is going to assume you have a basic understanding of how contacts work, if you don't know how they work read the page on them or watch a guide.\n\nThis is an example inventory setup for medium contracts. This gives you every seed that the contract could assign except [[White lily|white lilies]] as well as all the other seeds you want to keep. If you do manage to get some white lilies from [[Hespori]] add them to your setup.\n\nSeeds in the seed box: [[Maple seed|maple]], [[Yew seed|yew]], [[Magic seed|magic]], [[Potato cactus seed|potato cactus]], [[Cactus seed|cactus]], [[Poison ivy seed|poison ivy]].{{Inventory|||||||||Limpwurt seed|Whiteberry seed|Jangerberry seed|Snape grass seed|Strawberry seed|Watermelon seed|Lantadyme seed|Snapdragon seed|Kwuarm seed|Avantoe seed|Irit seed|Toadflax seed|Ranarr seed|Harralander seed|Marrentill seed|Guam seed|Seed box|Looting bag|Coins|Rune pouch}}\n\nYou are '''not''' keeping [[tarromin]], [[dwarf weed]] or [[torstol]] seeds. You '''are''' keeping [[Guam leaf|guam]] and [[Marrentill|marrentil]] seeds if making [[Guam-marr vial|Guam-marr vials]] (Recommended).\n\nPre-plant: [[Watermelon seed|watermelon]], [[Snape grass seed|snape grass]], [[Cactus seed|cactus]], [[Whiteberry seed|whiteberries]], [[Maple seed|maple tree]], [[Irit seed|irit]].\n\n* If you have white lillies pre-plant those, otherwise farm [[Limpwurt root|limpwurt roots]] with that patch.\n\n* If you get a white lilly contract, downgrade it to an easy one and do that instead. Most of the seeds for easy contracts can be obtained from master farmers fairly commonly.\n\n* You can do some birdhouse runs to get the basic tree seeds, or just downgrade them when you get them (until you get some seeds from contracts).\n\n* Any other seeds you wish to keep can be put in the looting bag to be used later.\n\n* Once you get a hespori seed, plant it. You can also try and kill hespori with any future seeds you get.\n\n<u>Thieving:</u>\n\nWhile your crops are growing, the most efficient thing you can do is Thieving. When you start out, it is only recommended to pickpocket master farmers the minimum amount required to maintain contracts. Don't even worry about doing herb runs yet, you can just do some guams and marrentils as you get them but don't go out of the way for seeds to farm.  \n\n[[Ultimate Ironman Guide/Thieving]]  {{Checklist|*Instead of doing master farmers right away, [[blackjack]] or thieve [[Ardougne knight]]s until you have around 3m coins. That gives 1.5m for Smithing, 750k for Construction, then 750k for random stuff.\n*If you want to get no-fail master farmers, it is better to get the [[Thieving cape]] than it is to try to complete the [[Ardougne hard|Ardougne hard diary]] since it has high requirments. \n*Once you reach your goal level (3m gp, or whatever level you want), you can start on master farmers.\n**Draynor Village is a good place to thieve master farmers as you can buy wines at the shop there. Your Draynor manor teleport gets you close. There are plenty of other location options though.\n*Once you have all the herb seeds needed, clean up your inventory and move on to the other skills. Just keep your seed box on you with the seeds you are planning to farm, then bag the noted herbs.\n*Farm limpwurt roots and white berries to match your kwuarms and cadantines. Also get 20 extra limpwurt roots for [[Temple of Ikov]].\n*At level 78 you unlock [[Chest (Dorgesh-Kaan Rich)|Dorgesh-Kaan Rich Chests]]. This is a very good alternative to blackjacking for fast experience after you get the money you need. \n**With more effort, you can alch and cut the loot from the chests for very efficient money and Magic/Crafting experience. While small, this would add up significantly if you are going to 99.}}\n\nIf you need to get something out of your looting bag, you can die to Hespori or deathpile.\n\n70 Herblore requires ~740k total xp. Here are some rough xp estimates per seed, assuming 8 herbs per seed. This is not going to be perfect, but should get you in the ballpark.  \n\n'''<u>Important:</u>''' You will need a [[cadantine seed]] for Song of the Elves, so hold on to at least 1!\n\n*[[Guam seed]]s: 680xp (Guam-Mar vials)\n*[[Marrentill seed]]s: 700xp (Guam-Mar vials)\n*[[Harralander seed]]s: 590xp\n*[[Ranarr seed]]s: 760xp\n*[[Irit seed]]: 870xp\n*[[Avantoe seed]]s: 980xp\n*[[Kwuarm seed]]s: 1100xp\n*[[Snapdragon seed]]s: 1200xp\n*[[Cadantine seed]]s: 1300xp\n*[[Lantadyme seed]]s: 1500xp ([[Magic potion|magic potions]], which you can't do until 76 Herblore so don't count these).\n\n<u>Using your herbs:</u>\n\nRather than outline how to use all the herbs here, the [[Ultimate Ironman Guide/Herblore]] has a great list. \n\nThe main difference is you will be making [[Guam-marr vial]] vials for all of your guams and marrentils. Doing this vastly speeds up how fast you collect the herb seeds needed for level 70 as both seeds are very common from master farmers.\n\nThe wiki page on [[waking sleep vial]] has a description of the method, or you can refer to the video in the Discussions tab at the top left of the guide.\n\nYou will need to store most of your items in Hespori to clean up your inventory. Technically you could die in this method (unlikely though), so you could bring a looting bag instead if you would like.\n\nYou can farm while doing this method by just keeping a rune pouch and seed box on you if you would like. (Farm more guams and marrentils or have a looting bag to store other noted herbs).\n\nWhen you are done farming herbs, <u>leave yourself with 2 grown guam patches, 1 marrentil patch, and 1 harrlander patch</u>. This will make getting [[Guthix rest|guthix rests]] for Seren easy later on.\n\n====Smithing====\nSmithing is straightforward but expensive. [[Ultimate Ironman Guide/Smithing]]\n{{Checklist|*[[Superheat]] iron until 60. This is estimated to cost around 1.5m to go from 40-60 Smithing.\n\n*Do Blast Furnace platebodies until 70.}}The iron ore method method is expensive, but is the most efficient due to the Mining and Magic xp you get along the way. You can get 25 free inventory slots for 5 [[Iron platebody|iron platebodies]] if you have a clean inventory and use fire runes rather than a fire staff.\n\nIf you do it that way you can't hold a seed box to farm, so it is up to you. Do this first so you can use the full Blast Furnace while doing Construction and get the Mining xp.\n\n====Construction====\nMethods:\n\n* The default method for Construction is to just do [[Mahogony Homes]] oaks until 70 just like before. This is estimated to cost around 750k.\n* The second method would be to do [[Tempoross]] for fishing XP, then use the noted planks at Mahogany Homes. This is basically the better version of doing [[Wintertodt]] as fishing is actually useful later on.\n* Finally you could do solo [[Wintertodt]] to 70. The only real advantage to this is you will get your [[magic logs]] knocked out, but this really isn't recommended for the reasons outlined in the Wintertodt section.\n\nKeep in mind that getting 70 Construction allows you to build the [[Revitalisation pool|stamina pool]] in your house, but you would have to [[Theatre of Blood]] boost to get them early. \n\nYou can farm while doing Construction as it only really costs 2 inventory slots (seed box, looting bag), which is not as big of a deal once you get a [[plank sack]].\n\n====Mining====\nMining is again pretty straightforward. You will buy a [[rune pickaxe]] from a shop and do your preferred Mining method to level 70.\n\n* [[Ultimate Ironman Guide/Mining]]\n\nIf you would like, you can get 72 Mining and complete [[Making Friends with My Arm]] for an extra patch and teleports.\n\n====Hunter====\nHunter is again pretty straightforward. \n\n* Follow the [[Ultimate Ironman Guide/Hunter]] until 70. The only difference is to just do red salamanders to 70 rather than 69.\n\nPost 70 Hunter should be done at the [[Red chinchompa|red chins]] after you finish Song of the Elves and [[Monkey Madness II|Monkey Madness 2]], when you are ready to use them to train ranged.\n\n<u>Do not plan to get a [[Amulet of glory|glory]] from Hunter, just do Crafting.</u> This is just general advice really, but finding [[Dragon impling|Dragon implings]] is a long and tedious process that just isn't worth it. \n\n====Woodcutting====\nWoodcutting is yet again very straightforward. Just chop wood with your preferred method.\n\n* [[Ultimate Ironman Guide/Woodcutting]] \n\n* Buy a rune axe from the woodcutting guild when you get the level \n* It is recommended to actually get 75 woodcutting rather than 70. This will solve your magic log problem easily for [[Mourning's End Part I]], and [[Desert Treasure]], as well as give access to magic logs forever on your account. \n\nYou could opt to do Wintertodt until 66 [[Firemaking]] (after getting 70 Woodcutting for better log drops) and see if you get lucky with 13 magic logs, but it is unlikely in that short amount of time. Do not do [[Nature impling]]s as it takes a long time with almost no xp gains.\n\n====Magic====\nYou should be passively getting Magic xp from alching and a lot of these other activities (superheating). You need to have level 82 by the time you go for Song of the Elves. If you don't end up with 82 by the time you are done with the other skilling grinds, a very fast method is to do the Alchemy room in Mage Training arena. When done properly you can get around 140k xp/h there, though lower rates are more likely due to mistakes. It does cost money, so you will have to thieve a good bit more if you plan to do this.\n\n===Finishing up===\nOnce you have all your skills lined out, it is time to finish everything up. Now that you have a supply of [[Prayer potion]]s and [[Super restore]]s, these quests are much easier.\n\nBuy [[karambwan]]s from Brimhaven for good food.\n{{Checklist|\n*Complete [[Mourning's End Part I]].\n**Chop your own [[magic logs]] if you got 75 woodcutting, otherwise do Wintertodt for them.\n*Complete [[Mourning's End Part II]].\n*[[Temple of Ikov]]\n**Kill [[Angry barbarian spirit]]s for a [[yew shortbow]].\n**Keep the shortbow to use during Song of the Elves so you can use rune arrows.\n*Complete [[Desert Treasure]].\n**Again, chop the magic logs or get them from Wintertodt.\n**Do not buy an [[ancient staff]] until right before fighting Seren.\n**You can use the diamonds on the pyramid as you get them, you don't have to get all 4 first.\n*Complete [[Song of the Elves]] until the final boss fight.\n**Complete the quest 1 section at a time, don't try to collect all the items at the start.\n**You should have a [[cadantine seed]] from farming.\n**Get a [[runite bar]] from [[magpie impling]]s.\n**Use your basic range setup with the yew shortbow and rune arrows from Last Man Standing for the combat sections other than the final boss.\n**Death pile and knock out [[Mage Arena 1]] and optionally [[Mage Arena II]] before prepping for the boss.\n**It may be possible to complete [[A Kingdom Divided]] now for a better off-hand, but it isn't needed.}}\n\n====Fragment of Seren====\nYou are almost there, only the fight remains!\n\nFighting the [[Fragment of Seren]] boss is either a struggle, or fairly easy, depending on how prepared you are.\n\nThe recommended method is to use [[Phoenix necklace]]s with [[Cave nightshade]]. Together these can negate the damage from the bosses major attack that deals almost all of your health in damage.\n\n<u>Getting set up</u>{{Checklist|*Get your noted [[super restore]]s out of your bag if you don't have them.\n*wear a fire staff until you get the ancient staff.\n* Start out by making a [[Guthix rest]] with the herbs you left planted from farming. If you forgot to do this, then you could farm them now, or just use a karambwan/pineapple pizza. \n*Get a candle from Catherby and light it.\n*Buy a lockpick from Burthope.\n*Thieve [[Chest (Dorgesh-Kaan Rich)|Dorgesh Kaan rich chests]] until you get 9 uncut diamonds and a sapphire. \n*Make 9 [[phoenix necklace]]s.\n*Make an [[amulet of magic]]. wear it.\n*Get an empty book from the lighthouse. wear it.\n*Put up your graceful.\n*Get your mage arena cape out of your house, wear it.\n*You should have rune arrows already.\n*Buy full mystic at the Magic Guild.\n*Buy 700 bloods, deaths, and water runes. This is more than you should need, but it is best to be safe.\n*Clear out your rune pouch of other runes and put the deaths, bloods, and waters in it for space. If you have a lot of law runes, you can put most of them in your bag.\n*Collect 10 [[cave nightshade]]. You will need to reobtain the [[skavid map]].\n**Practice eating a few nightshade to get used to it. Eating a nightshade is a right click option with a text box!\n**The extra nightshade is there in case you mess up and need 1 more.\n*Drop the candle.\n*Ring of dueling to the duel arena, go south into the desert all the way to the ancients pyramid. You can take the boat to Tempoross to get there faster.\n*Change to the [[ancient spellbook]].\n*Buy an [[ancient staff]] from [[Elbis]].\n*Ring of dueling to clan wars. Restore your stats, use the portal to get to soul wars, then edgeville.\n*Unnote 3 super restores and bag any extra noted restores you have.\n**You will need to drop something on the ground and return for it after you bag them.\n*Minigame teleport to the Fishing Trawler. Take the charter ship to [[Port Tyras]] and walk to the boss room.}}\n\n<u>The fight</u>\n\nA video of this method can be found in the Discussions tab of the page.\n\nAt the start of the fight, let Seren take you down to ~30–40% of your HP. Activate [[Protect from Missiles]] after.\n\nTry to stay at around 20% of your max HP + 10 HP during the fight. At 99 HP this would mean staying at around 30 HP. The phoenix necklace breaks if you drop down below 20% of your max HP, and a cave nightshade deals up to 15 damage when eaten.\n\nUse Blood Blitz whenever you want your HP to go up, and the non-blood spell whenever you want it to go down. Manual cast the spells to avoid wasting DPS.\n\nIf you happen to have an alternate account with Song of the Elves completed, it is recommended to try this method on that account first as practice. The boss can be refought in Prifddinas.\n\nKeep in mind prayer might be a bit limited, especially if you only got level 45. You might have to prayer flick to get through the whole fight. \n\nMore info about the Fragment of Seren's mechanics can be found [[Fragment of Seren#Mechanics|here]].\n\n{{Equipment\n|align = right\n|head = Mystic hat\n|cape = Zamorak cape\n|neck = Amulet of magic\n|ammo = Rune arrow\n|weapon = Ancient staff\n|torso = Mystic robe top\n|legs = Mystic robe bottom\n|shield = Book of darkness\n|gloves = Mystic gloves\n|boots = Mystic boots\n|ring = Ring of dueling\n}}\n{{Inventory|Yew shortbow|Guthix rest|Phoenix necklace|Cave nightshade|Phoenix necklace|Phoenix necklace|Phoenix necklace|Phoenix necklace|Cave nightshade|Cave nightshade|Cave nightshade|Cave nightshade|Phoenix necklace|Phoenix necklace|Phoenix necklace|Phoenix necklace|Cave nightshade|Cave nightshade|Cave nightshade|Cave nightshade|Cave nightshade|Super restore|Super restore|Super restore|Seed box|Coins|Looting bag|rune pouch\n}}\n\n'''Congratulations!''' You have completed this guide and are now ready to take on the world as an Ultimate Ironman! \n\n<u>Please take just a few minutes and leave a comment</u> in the Discussions tab at the top left of the page to say you got through the guide and any feedback you have. If you got through the whole thing without issues, please say so! That is valuable feedback! \n\n====Tips for the path forward====\nHere are some useful tips and pointers to guide you as you face the road ahead. Feel free to forge your own path though! \n\nFor many, the next step forward will be to start on [[Slayer]] so that you can complete [[Monkey Madness II]] and grow your stats for [[The Gauntlet]]. \n\n<u>Ancient Staff:</u> \n\nKeep in mind that you cannot buy more than 1 ancient staff, and they are otherwise difficult to get. Don't alch or drop the staff. \n\n<u>The Gauntlet:</u> \n\n[[The Gauntlet]] is very doable without [[Rigor]] and [[Augury]], even with lower stats. You may have to prep tier 2 armour though.\n\nIf you are already experienced then you can do 5:1 with Mage right away. If you are less experienced you could afk train your range to ~80 and use Mage/Range only. This allows you to get into [[Corrupted gauntlet]] much sooner.\n\n<u>Konar:</u>\n\nUsing [[Konar quo Maten]] as a slayer master is very useful as her assignment list does not have many \"bad\" tasks if you have not started [[Dragon Slayer I]]. You will probably want to block [[Black demon]]s though.\n\nShe provides the most [[Slayer points]], is easy to get to from the [[Battlefront Teleport]], and the random locations she assigns is not so bad when using [[Bones to Peaches]] for sustain. The [[Brimstone key]] drops also provide a bit of extra loot.\n\n<u>Prayer:</u>\n\nYou will want to train prayer to 70+ before getting too deep into The Gauntlet if you are using melee. \n\nYou can use the same method as before, but should get higher range from chins first. You could consider using better range weapons (magic shortbow, crystal bow, rune crossbow), but the requirements and cost of a death are higher.\n\nThe crystal bow is particularly effective over time if you invest in lowering the recharge fee. This is a solid idea if you got a lot of extra money from thieving earlier (and don't die in the wilderness much).\n\nThe melee setup in the [[Ultimate Ironman Guide/Prayer]] is also good, but does require a source of food to tank the dragons.  \n\nAlternatively, keep in mind that technically the efficient way to train prayer is to do a lot of [[Runecraft]] and unlock [[Wrath rune|Wrath runes]] to use with [[Sinister Offering]] or [[Demonic Offering]].  \n\nThis is very macro efficient, but requires an extremely large time investment to setup.  \n\n<u>Fire Cape:</u> \n\n* You can now complete the [[Fight Caves]] rather easily by obtaining a [[Crystal weapon seed]] from Last Man Standing and charging at the [[Singing bowl]] into a [[Crystal bow]]. You can get [[Crystal shard|Crystal shards]] many ways so choose your preferred method.\n\n* The basic ranged gear from earlier should be good enough due to the good base stats on the crystal bow, but you could use [[Black dragonhide armour]] if you do crafting or [[Void Knight equipment]].\n*Keep in mind you will also want a crystal bow for the Monkey Madness 2 boss fight.\n\n<u>Recipe for Disaster:</u> \n\n* Get 70 [[Cooking]] before completing [[Monkey Madness I]] if you did not complete it earlier for experience so that you can complete [[Recipe for Disaster/Freeing King Awowogei]] right afterwards.  \n\n* It is tempting to obtain [[Barrows gloves]] for the slayer grind, but most likely it is not worth doing so as completing [[Dragon Slayer I]] will allow you to receive dragon tasks. Just use [[Rune gloves]] while you are getting started with [[Slayer points]].\n\n<u>Berserker ring:</u>\n\nYou can obtain a [[Berserker ring]] using [[Iban Blast]] or even [[Fire Bolt]] with [[Chaos gauntlets]] if you are short on money. You don't need amazing tank gear.  \n\n<u>Proselyte:</u>  \n\n[[Proselyte armour]], specifically the chest and legs, is very useful for slayer if you are camping [[Protection prayers]] and/or [[piety]] during your tasks. If you did pickpocket a lot of master farmers for seeds, you likely have plenty of prayer potions.  \n\n<u>Obsidian legs:</u> \n\n(Very optional) [[Obsidian platelegs]] can be obtained by buying [[Chaos rune|Chaos runes]] and selling them at [[TzHaar-Mej-Roh's Rune Store]] with [[Karamja gloves 1]]. This is a bit expensive (~1m), but they are the best storable melee legs. You will have to buy the whole set to store, but if you don't plan to use a bag slot for [[Bandos tassets]] late game then you might as well get these early. Keep in mind that if you are camping prayers, then proselyte is going to be better.   \n\n<u>Clue Scrolls:</u> \n\nThere are a lot of good storable items that can be obtained from [[Clue scroll (hard)|Hard Clue scrolls]], but nothing is actually that vital to get. For range gear you will likely want to use [[Crystal armour]] with the [[Bow of faerdhinen]]. [[Blessed d'hide boots]] are nice but not needed as [[Shayzien boots (5)]] grant only 3 fewer attack and are much easier to obtain.  \n\n<u>Chins:</u> \n\nOnce you complete Monkey Madness 2 you can catch [[Red chinchompa|Red chinchompas]] in [[Prifddinas]] to grow your range rather fast. ~90 range should be fine, but higher does help if you don't mind hunting. \n\n<u>Bursting:</u> \n\nUsing [[Ice Burst]] for slayer is reasonably doable if you complete the [[Desert Hard Diary]] to get the better [[camulet]] teleport. You want this diary anyway for making noted unfinished potions.  \n\n<u>Bones to Peaches:</u> \n\nUsing the [[Bones to Peaches]] spell unlocked early in the guide will make slayer much easier as it provides an easy way to get food.  \n\n<u>Fighter Torso:</u>  \n\nYou of course want to knock out a [[Fighter torso]]. It only takes a few hours and is storable.   \n\n<u>Dragon Defender:</u>   \n\nThe [[dragon defender]] is actually storable in a stash unit with a [[Slayer helmet]] and [[Dragon battleaxe]]. The Construction level is pretty high though.\n\n==Notable Alternatives==\n===What about Wintertodt?===\nMany players will be surprised by the lack of [[Wintertodt]] early on. Conventional wisdom says that rushing early Wintertodt is efficient, but the reality is that for the majority of players it is a complete waste of time. As outlined in this guide, you can be very successful without spending 50+ hours at Wintertodt. Below will break down the reasoning for this.\n\n* First and foremost, the number 1 reason not to do Wintertodt is simply that [[Firemaking]] is effectively a useless skill past level 66 (The highest quest requirement) Past that, the only relevant requirement are the Kourend and Kandarin diaries, and a master clue step, which have very high other requirements to get first. This means that doing Wintertodt early is really only for the non-Firemaking xp and loot, which brings us to...\n* The loot from Wintertodt sucks. It doesn't matter if you are maxed, the loot still sucks. Sure over the course of 50+ hours it adds up to something decent, but compared to other things you could do for that time it is abysmal.\n* You can get [[Construction]] elsewhere. The primary reasoning for doing Wintertodt is really the Construction experience, but you can do other methods that are much faster. Having early Construction does not save you the 50 hours you would spend getting it at Wintertodt. Getting 70 Construction through oak contracts takes about 20 hours and is very cheap, while also giving woodcutting xp like Wintertodt. The [[Fletching]] xp is nice, but you can easily buy fletching later from [[The Gauntlet|Gauntlet]] money.\n* The [[Tome of fire]] is not necessary, and will be dropped eventually. Tome of Fire is great early game, but it really falls off after most questing has been done. Especially now with the [[Book of the dead]] acting as a re-obtainable mage offhand with teleports too. Similarly, all the extra loot will be difficult to use early on, and moving it in an out of the bag will take a lot of time for relatively little reward compared to just doing more streamlined methods down the line.\n* Finally, you need to do the quests anyways. The majority of the time spent in this guide is just doing quests, and even if you do Wintertodt you still have to spend time on the quests. Having Construction early helps with teleports, but does not save 50 hours.\n\n===Boneyard Prayer===\nPlayers that are interested in an easier and safer early game can start their journey with a visit to the [[Bone Yard]], where they will collect [[Big bones]], then use them on the wilderness [[Chaos Altar (Prayer)|Chaos Altar]] for 43 [[Prayer]]. This unlocks the [[Protect from Melee]] prayer right away. \n\nHaving protection from melee makes many quest bosses trivial, and heavily reduces the need for food. Additionally, gaining these total levels early will allow you to unlock a [[Rune pouch]] a bit sooner.\n\nThe downside to this method is that it is a somewhat tedious ~3 hour grind right at the start of your account and some players might wish to jump into more active progress.\n\nOverall doing this method doesn't really gain or lose much time in the long run. The slow xp rates are offset by the extra time gained by being able to easily move through difficult sections without food and ends up about even. \n\nIf you are not comfortable navigating the early game safely (for example if this is your first ironman account) then doing this method is highly recommended as dying can cost a lot of time on an UIM. \n\n<u>If you do this method here are some steps.</u>\n\n1) Drop all of your items except your shrimp and bread.\n\n2) [[Clan Wars]] minigame teleport.\n\n3) Exit the [[Ferox Enclave]] and head north east to the [[Bone Yard]]\n\n4) Pick up the [[Big bones]] spawn at the south west end. Avoid the skeletons, they will attack you.\n\n5) Hop worlds and pick up big bones until you have a full inventory.\n\n6) Head north then west to the [[Chaos Temple (hut)|Chaos Altar]]. \n\n7) Use your big bones on the altar.\n\n8) Return to the boneyard for more bones. Repeat this until you have 43 prayer. \n\n9) On your last trip of bones, grab a few [[Iron scimitar|Iron scimitars]] from the spawn next to the big bones. \n\n10) When finished, return to the Ferox Enclave, restore your run to full at the pool, and Lumbridge home teleport.\n\n11) Sell your iron scimitars at the general store, then proceed with the guide from there. \n\nNote that you don't have a many prayer points, so it is best to utilize [[Prayer Flicking]] to extend your points further."}

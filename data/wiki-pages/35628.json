This is to settle in new moderators into their role as part of a training period.

We vary the raw trawl of accounts from time to time to fit our needs, for example we have recently focused on OS game bias from Australian time zones.\n<p><br />\nOnce we have that list we review each account for reports made about it, display name history and linked accounts to identify rule breaking on undesirable behaviour on alternative accounts. We then do some due diligence checks to see if any of the accounts are linked to cheating communities or have any links or concerns in relation to Community Safety issues. Once we have that list we extract any accounts that log in from countries whose Authorities provide public searchable *** offender records and, where possible, run a sense check against public records. We then run a hijacking check to see if the account user is involved in account phishing or other activity such as name selling or account selling and then finally a check of any payment fraud history. We sometimes do a few further adhoc checks such as removing accounts with a lot of public wi-fi or proxy access.\n<br /><br />\nOnce we have that final list the players can be invited and if they accept the invite they will move into a state where they can't mute anyone and their reports are closely monitored for about 2 months. Once we are happy that the reporting is of a good standard we move the account to a full P Mod status which means they can mute and also that the accounts are then checked weekly for security, activity and mute accuracy.\n<br /><br />\nHope that helps.\n</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"quotation-mark\" style=\"width:20px; vertical-align:bottom; font-size:40px; font-family:serif; font-weight:bold; text-align:right; padding:10px 10px;\">”\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&#160;\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top\"><div style=\"line-height:1em;text-align: right\"><cite style=\"font-style:normal;\">&#8212; <a href=\"https://runescape.wiki/w/Mod_SteveW\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"rsw:Mod SteveW\">Mod SteveW</a> on Reddit<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup></cite></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p><br />\nPlayers with old, expired offences may still become Player Moderators if Jagex feels that they have learned their lesson.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> Though you do not have to play a certain amount of time, most moderators have played 1 year or more before being asked to join the team.

Everyone has 'off' days, and we learn from our mistakes, and as such, it is important that if you do have offences, you have learned from them.

Anyone who claims to be a Player Moderator without a crown can be reported (for staff impersonation) using the [[report abuse]] menu. While acknowledged as not actually being hired members of the Jagex Staff (only regular players with extra entrusted tools), the rule is still applicable to impersonation of them.\n[[File:Report_Abuse_form.png|thumb|Player Moderators can tick the \"Mute player (Moderators only)\" option.]]\nA Player Moderator has direct approaches to [[Code of Conduct|rulebreakers]]. To safeguard other members of the community from disruptive or offensive players they have the ability to issue a priority abuse report which will, with an immediate effect, temporarily [[mute]] the reported player to give [[Jagex]] staff members some time to review the incident.{{CiteGeneral|url=https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/209270969|title=Moderators and Community Helpers|author=Jagex Support|date=20 July 2016|accessdate=14 March 2019|publisher=Jagex|archiveurl=http://archive.fo/f7I13|archivedate=13 March 2019|quote=PMods help Jagex by protecting the community from disruptive or offensive players.

This is to settle in new moderators into their role as part of a training period. Once Jagex has assessed the judgement of the moderator, the in-game behaviour as well as social and forum posts, and the reports marked for muting would have been applied correctly, then the moderator would be given the full responsibility with the normal mute option.{{CiteGeneral|url=https://runescape.podbean.com/e/pmods-exposed/|title=PMods Exposed|author=Mod Stevew (8m 18s)|quote=There is a period where they can Suggest a Mute, and that means that they would have applied a mute in the situation, but the player isn't actually muted; and that report comes to us, and we look at it carefully, and we're assessing the judgement of that person; and only when we're really satisfied that they're consistently applying mutes or would apply mutes correctly do we turn on that additional ability to be able to mute people.}}{{CiteGeneral|url=http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/forums.ws?254,255,597,66019301|title=Player Moderators|author=Mod Gambit|date=13 June 2018|accessdate=14 March 2019|publisher=Jagex|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/SoSMi|archivedate=14 March 2019|quote=A new P-Mod will be monitored for the first three months.

A Player Moderator's mute is a safety precaution to help prevent the player in question from causing any more harm to themselves or others, as it will effectively stop any attempts to talk freely.{{NamedRef|pmod temporarily mute reasons}} Jagex provides Player Moderators with muting guidelines{{CiteGeneral|url=https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/209270969|title=Moderators and Community Helpers|author=Jagex Support|date=20 July 2016|accessdate=14 March 2019|publisher=Jagex|archiveurl=http://archive.fo/f7I13|archivedate=13 March 2019|quote=Experienced PMods may be invited to become a PMod Mentor.

Any incorrect mutes may be lifted, and if a Player Moderator regularly mutes without proper reason, their moderator status may be removed. As soon as a Jagex Moderator checks the report, the mute is lifted and a subsequent punishment is then applied if it is needed.\n\n[[Private chat|Private messages]] sent by a Player Moderator will remain visible when private chat is filtered to friends, or turned off, by the recipient player. Player Moderators cannot send messages, or view the online status of, players who do not have them added to their friends list and have their private status set to 'friends'. If the other player has their status set as 'offline', Player Moderators cannot see their online status, or send messages to the player, even if they are mutually added.\n\nIf a player adds a Player Moderator to their [[Ignore List]], they will not see any additional messages from that player.\n\nPlayer Moderators have access to additional forum sections, in which they can discuss moderator issues with other Player Moderators and their dedicated Jagex Moderator curators.{{CiteGeneral|url=https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/209270969|title=Moderators and Community Helpers|author=Jagex Support|date=20 July 2016|accessdate=14 March 2019|publisher=Jagex|archiveurl=http://archive.fo/f7I13|archivedate=13 March 2019|quote=They also have access to private forums where they can discuss moderation and community issues with other PMods and dedicated JMod curators.}} [[Jagex]] states that content discussed within these areas is strictly confidential, and any Player Moderator who reveals content within these areas will lose their moderator privileges.\n\n==How Player Moderators are chosen==\n[[File:Receiving and losing Player Moderator status.png|thumb|A player becomes a player moderator and has it removed afterwards.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Meadows|url=https://twitter.com/JagexMeadows/status/940953304393244672|date=13 December 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/PjlIO|archivedate=30 May 2020|quote=Testing out Community Manager PMod tools on @JagexWolf's 2nd account...

We vary the raw trawl of accounts from time to time to fit our needs, for example we have recently focused on OS game bias from Australian time zones.\n<br/>\nOnce we have that list we review each account for reports made about it, display name history and linked accounts to identify rule breaking on undesirable behaviour on alternative accounts. We then do some due diligence checks to see if any of the accounts are linked to cheating communities or have any links or concerns in relation to Community Safety issues. Once we have that list we extract any accounts that log in from countries whose Authorities provide public searchable *** offender records and, where possible, run a sense check against public records. We then run a hijacking check to see if the account user is involved in account phishing or other activity such as name selling or account selling and then finally a check of any payment fraud history. We sometimes do a few further adhoc checks such as removing accounts with a lot of public wi-fi or proxy access.\n<br/><br/>\nOnce we have that final list the players can be invited and if they accept the invite they will move into a state where they can't mute anyone and their reports are closely monitored for about 2 months. Once we are happy that the reporting is of a good standard we move the account to a full P Mod status which means they can mute and also that the accounts are then checked weekly for security, activity and mute accuracy.\n<br/><br/>\nHope that helps.|{{RSL|Mod SteveW}}|on Reddit{{CiteGeneral|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/8lg7v9/jagex_pmod_selection_btw/dzfn9ay/|title=Jagex Pmod selection btw|author=Mod SteveW|date=23 May 2018|accessdate=16 March 2019|archiveurl=http://archive.fo/Yo1cU|archivedate=23 May 2018}}}}\n\n\nPlayers with old, expired offences may still become Player Moderators if Jagex feels that they have learned their lesson.{{CiteGeneral|url=http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/forums.ws?254,255,597,66019301|title=Player Moderators - Community Home - RuneScape Forum|author=Mod Gambit|date=13 June 2018|accessdate=14 March 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/SoSMi|archivedate=14 June 2018|quote=I have offences, does this affect my chances of being a Player Moderator? No, not always. Unless the offences are particularly serious, we give everyone a chance. We understand that people change and mature over time.}} Though you do not have to play a certain amount of time, most moderators have played 1 year or more before being asked to join the team. It is mentioned that being on the forums helps being noticed.\n\nSenior Player Moderators are able to put forward players to become new Player Moderators, although this only fast tracks them being noticed by Jagex and does not cause them to face any less scrutiny.{{Fact}}\n\nJagex will '''only''' contact the player via the Message Centre system to inform them that they have been selected to become a Player Moderator. The player is then able to accept or decline the position. Jagex will '''''never''''' private message you in-game and tell you to go to an external website and enter your username and password.{{CiteGeneral|url=https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/209270969|title=Moderators and Community Helpers|author=Jagex Support|accessdate=13 March 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/f7I13|archivedate=13 March 2019|quote=No Mods or Helpers will ever contact you out of the blue via email or other sites to request information from you or make offers (such as PMod status), and you should never give out information such as your password - even to Mods.\n\nJagex will only ever contact you through your In-Game Message Centre, and will never ask for your password.}} People messaging that are phishers who steal account logins, and they can be reported for staff impersonation.\n\nAny player asking in-game for your login details should be reported '''immediately''' so Jagex can punish them accordingly. Also, if you are asked by a player in in-game chat to log out into the lobby as you have been chosen to become a moderator, report them promptly, as this is a phishing attempt as well.\n\n==Player Moderator teams==\nPlayer Moderators are split into two \"teams\": community-oriented and moderation-oriented. Each of these teams have their own dedicated Jagex Moderator to refer to.{{CiteGeneral|url=http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/forums.ws?254,255,597,66019301|title=Player Moderators - Community Home - RuneScape Forum|author=Mod Gambit|date=13 June 2018|accessdate=14 March 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/SoSMi|archivedate=14 June 2018|quote=Regular P-Mods are split into two “teams”. We have community oriented and moderation oriented P-Mods however there is lots of overlap. Each of these teams have their own dedicated J-Mod to refer to. We also have a team within the P-Mods known as the Mentors.}}\n\nThere is also another group of Player Moderators, the Player Moderator Mentors: an experienced group of Player Moderators who have been chosen to help guide newer Player Moderators. They work with Jagex on processes such as recruitment and communicating changes to the other Player Moderators.{{CiteGeneral|url=http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/forums.ws?254,255,597,66019301|title=Player Moderators - Community Home - RuneScape Forum|author=Mod Gambit|date=13 June 2018|accessdate=14 March 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/SoSMi|archivedate=14 June 2018|quote=The P-Mod Mentors are an experienced group P-Mods who have been chosen to help guide newer P-Mods. We work with them on processes such as recruitment and communicating changes to the other P-Mods. They are highly active within the community, in and out of game and we are lucky to have them!}}\n\n==Misconceptions==\nThere are many misconceptions regarding Player Moderators and their abilities. In simple terms, they are the same as regular players, but with the ability to temporarily [[mute]] other players and access special Moderator forums. Some myths about Player Moderators and their abilities are, in fact, true for [[Jagex Moderator]]s, however. Here is a list of myths about Player Moderators, along with the truth:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"90%\"\n! width=\"20%\" |Myth\n! width=\"60%\" |Truth\n|-\n|Player Moderators are given free benefits, including free items, [[experience]], or [[member]]ship.\n|Player Moderators do '''not''' receive any type of reward for being a Player Moderator, and have to pay for membership and work for their items and experience like any other player. Before [[Jagex]] allowed qualifying free players to post on the forums, player moderators were able to use them regardless of their membership status. However, Jagex has said that it was an accident, so at the time, asked player moderators not to post in any forums besides the Player Moderator Forums. Now, though, any mod can post on the forums as part of the \"qualifying free players\".\n|-\n|Player Moderators can change their [[level]]s whenever they want.\n|Player Moderators '''cannot''' change their levels except through training like normal players. However, [[Jagex Moderator]]s can change their own levels for testing purposes.\n|-\n|Player Moderators can get any item they want.\n|Player Moderators '''cannot''' generate any items they want and must work towards obtaining items like any other player. However, it has been shown on various occasion that [[Jagex Moderator]]s can generate any items they want for testing purposes.\n|-\n|Player Moderators are invited to the Player Moderator team in-game or by e-mail.\n|[[Jagex]] will '''only''' notify a player that they have been invited via that player's ''RuneScape'' inbox. If there are any unread messages in a player's inbox, a red \"X\" will be shown in that section of the {{RSL|Lobby|lobby}} and in the information box will be a message containing the number of unread messages as well as a link to the player's inbox. Anyone telling you in-game or via email that you have been selected to become a Player Moderator is likely attempting to steal your password and should be [[Code of Conduct|reported]] for staff impersonation.\n|-\n|Player Moderators are told updates before they are publicly released.\n|This is not true in most cases, as there is a chance that information will be leaked, thus ruining the surprise for everyone. Occasionally, [[Jagex]] will allow moderators to give advanced input on moderation-related updates, such as an update to a [[Code of Conduct|game rule]], or the reporting system.\n|-\n|Only [[members]] are allowed to become Player Moderators.\n|Any [[player]] may become a Player Moderator regardless of membership.\n|-\n|Player Moderators are chosen primarily based on the number of reports they make.\n|Quality of reports is far more important than quantity, and making large numbers of reports in the hope of becoming a Player Moderator is actually counterproductive. If a situation is doubtful, you may send a report, but keep in mind that there may be a better solution like asking \"Could we please talk about something else?\" or simply ignoring the other player. There are also several other factors besides the quantity/quality of reports that affect which players are chosen to become Player Moderators.\n|-\n|Players are chosen for modship because of their high [[Combat level]] or how long they have been playing the game.\n|Player Moderators are '''not''' simply high [[combat level]]led players nor are Player Moderators necessarily chosen for their time devoted to the game, though the more good information on a player Jagex obtains, the better. Many Moderators have combat levels of 126, but there are also many who have combat levels as low as 3.\n|-\n|Player Moderators ''must'' have absolutely no offences on their record.\n|\nAlthough having no offences may help your chances of becoming a Player Moderator, you do not have to have a shiny clean offence list to become one. Everyone has 'off' days, and we learn from our mistakes, and as such, it is important that if you do have offences, you have learned from them. Offences will typically only affect your chance of becoming a Player Moderator if you continuously violate the [[rules]], or if they are serious offences, such as scamming.\n|-\n|Player Moderators ''have'' to help someone in need.\n|Player Moderators are '''not''' obliged to help anyone and their cooperation is entirely voluntary. This even means that reporting and [[Muted|muting]] is optional as well, just as it is for normal players.\n|-\n|Player Moderators can either appeal offences for someone else, remove them entirely, or request them to be removed.\n|They '''cannot''' lift any [[ban]]s or undo [[Jagex]] actions against an account. The owner of the account in question is responsible for appealing the offence.\n|-\n|Player Moderators can ban other [[player]]s.\n|Player Moderators can only ''mute'' other players, not ban them.\n|-\n|Player Moderators ''are obligated'' to report players they see breaking the [[rules]].\n|Just like regular players, it is the Player Moderators discretion as to whether or not they choose to report a player breaking a [[rule]]. In fact, [[Jagex]] encourages their P-Mods to only report if it's absolutely necessary.\n|-\n|Player Moderators are given [[money]] to train [[skills]] and buy items instead of working to make their money.\n|Just like every other player, Player Moderators have to find their own ways of making money.\n|-\n|A Player Moderator's silver crown does not show up on [[clan chat]], [[public chat]], or private chat.\n|\nA Player Moderator's silver crown will always appear, regardless of type of chat, origin of chat, and destination of the chat '''nor''' can a Player Moderator turn off their crown temporarily. When someone is a Player Moderator, their crown will show up in every message everywhere and always. This is so that players cannot claim they have 'turned it off' for a while and possibly scam others.\n|}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Player Moderators will lose their moderator status when not logged in with a good play session within a 3 month period.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Meadows|url=https://twitter.com/JagexMeadows/status/970970572728434689|date=06 March 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/dWq09|archivedate=11 March 2018|quote=If a Pmod hasn’t logged in and had a good play session (like an hour of slayer or fishing etc) within a 3 month period they automatically lose their crown and Pmod status.

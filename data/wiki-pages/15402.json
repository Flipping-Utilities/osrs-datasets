title=\"Fourth Age\">Fourth Age</a>; no record of his birth or parents exists. A group of travellers seeking sanctuary from <a href=\"/w/Goblin\" title=\"Goblin\">goblins</a> and <a href=\"/w/Ogre\" title=\"Ogre\">ogres</a> found him as a child while following the <a href=\"/w/River_Lum\" title=\"River Lum\">River Lum</a>. The <a href=\"/w/Elders_of_Avarrocka\" title=\"Elders of Avarrocka\">elders of the tribe</a> saw him as a good omen, and set up camp at this place, naming it Avarrocka. Arrav was raised as their own; he was taught to <a href=\"/w/Hunter\" title=\"Hunter\">hunt</a>, <a href=\"/w/Farming\" title=\"Farming\">farm</a>, and even kill for times were cruel. He was described as unusually tall for someone so young, with dark eyes, fair hair and skin, and a kind smile.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Childhood_of_a_Hero_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Childhood_of_a_Hero-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Ten years passed, and the adults of the tribe reckoned Arrav to be around twelve years of age, yet he was still unnamed. As such the elders decided to send the child on a quest to find a name. After a number of days of travel, he discovered an encampment of goblins that planned to attack Avarrocka at night. As the goblins saw him they attacked, screaming \"<i>arrav</i>\", a word from their language. The goblins were defeated by Arrav, who after returning to Avarrocka and recounting the tale was thenceforth known by the name of \"<i>Arrav</i>\". As Arrav grew, so did Avarrocka.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Childhood_of_a_Hero_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Childhood_of_a_Hero-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Zemouregal's_threat\">Zemouregal's threat</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/Arrav?section=3&amp;veaction=edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: Zemouregal&#039;s threat\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/w/Arrav?action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Zemouregal&#039;s threat\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>One night Arrav visited the Land of Dreams wherein he encountered <a href=\"/w/Zemouregal\" title=\"Zemouregal\">Zemouregal</a>, who threatened Arrav and his town of <a href=\"/w/Varrock\" title=\"Varrock\">Avarrocka</a>. In fright he consulted with the <a href=\"/w/Elders_of_Avarrocka\" title=\"Elders of Avarrocka\">Elders of Avarrocka</a>, who decided the encounter was a bad omen and that Arrav could not remain in Avarrocka. It was at this time that the eldest of the elders who recounted a tale from his youth of a fabulous shield, a shield that did not belong to this <a href=\"/w/Gielinor\" title=\"Gielinor\">world</a> and whose whereabouts was unknown. The elders thus concocted what they deemed an impossible quest to find the shield and sent Arrav away.<sup id=\"cite_ref-A_Curse_in_the_Land_of_Dreams_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-A_Curse_in_the_Land_of_Dreams-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"A_strange_encounter\">A strange encounter</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/Arrav?section=4&amp;veaction=edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: A strange encounter\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/w/Arrav?action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: A strange encounter\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Arrav set out to the west, and soon came upon a strange house surrounded by mist. Unafraid, he entered the house and beheld three men heatedly arguing around a table; the language they spoke was unfamiliar, yet he could somehow understand it. The interlocutors, who took no notice of Arrav, seemed to be in a dispute about the ownership of the house they were standing in. One figure complained the others had crept in whilst he slept. Arrav noticed several other smaller figures huddled in the shadows. The speech of the place troubled Arrav, who decided to continue on his way.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Meeting_the_Imcando\">Meeting the Imcando</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/Arrav?section=5&amp;veaction=edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: Meeting the Imcando\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/w/Arrav?action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Meeting the Imcando\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Arrav continued his travels, eventually coming across the <a href=\"/w/Imcando_dwarf\" title=\"Imcando dwarf\">Imcando dwarves</a>. The Imcando feigned ignorance of the shield when asked, though Arrav was not fooled. Arrav stayed with the Imcando for many days, attempting to gain their trust and perhaps information about the shield. During this respite, Arrav became accustomed to dwarven practices, learning their ways of <a href=\"/w/Mining\" title=\"Mining\">Mining</a> and <a href=\"/w/Smithing\" title=\"Smithing\">Smithing</a>. In due time the <a href=\"/w/Imcando_chief\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Imcando chief\">leader of the Imcando</a> summoned Arrav, asking why he sought the fabled shield. Arrav explained  the threat <a href=\"/w/Zemouregal\" title=\"Zemouregal\">Zemouregal</a> posed to his town, though in vain: the Imcando feared Arrav and his elders were being manipulated, and that his presense would only alert Zemouregal of their settlement's presence. Thus, with a heavy heart, he was sent away.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"As_an_outcast\">As an outcast</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/Arrav?section=6&amp;veaction=edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: As an outcast\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/w/Arrav?action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: As an outcast\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Though the Imcando had welcomed him and told him they held the shield, he could do nothing but hope the shield could be found elsewhere. However, in all the places he travelled, few knew of the shield, and those that spoke with him paled from his presence at the mention of <a href=\"/w/Zemouregal\" title=\"Zemouregal\">Zemouregal</a>. And so, Arrav became an outcast, a wanderer with no home. His spirits nearly broken, he entered a cave in which he thought he might spend the rest of his days. This cave was not empty, and he found himself assaulted by a terrible beast, with great talons. The battle lasted two days, until at last light on the second day Arrav's sword reflected the setting sun, blinding the beast which he then slayed. Standing over his fallen foe, Arrav perceived that he was on a ruinous path and astray from his quest. Leaving this fell place, he set out for <a href=\"/w/Varrock\" title=\"Varrock\">Avarrocka</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_burning_of_Avarrocka\">The burning of Avarrocka</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/Arrav?section=7&amp;veaction=edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: The burning of Avarrocka\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/w/Arrav?action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: The burning of Avarrocka\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>As Arrav approached <a href=\"/w/Varrock\" title=\"Varrock\">Avarrocka</a>, he saw a billowing column of blackened smoke rising from the horizon. Rushing forward, he arrived only to find Avarrocka burned to the ground. In the smouldering remains of the town he encountered goblins, who had razed the place. Searching to the east of the town he found a band of surviving townspeople, and gathering the strongest men, he prepared a counter-attack. Before the attack commenced, he looked upon a comrade, filled with rage, and realised the assault would only cause a perpetual loop of violence and suffering. He took a stand, spoke loudly to the goblins and offered them peace, to which they accepted. The rebuilding of Avarrocka commenced.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Another_dream_and_the_shield_given\">Another dream and the shield given</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/Arrav?section=8&amp;veaction=edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: Another dream and the shield given\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/w/Arrav?action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Another dream and the shield given\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>With the town rebuilt and busier than ever before, Arrav grew ever more restless. Two years past before he encountered <a href=\"/w/Zemouregal\" title=\"Zemouregal\">Zemouregal</a> once more in the Land of Dream; this time Zemouregal threatened not only to destroy Avarrocka but all his people wherever they may be. Following this portent, Arrav left <a href=\"/w/Varrock\" title=\"Varrock\">Avarrocka</a> a second time.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Arrav returned to the <a href=\"/w/Imcando_dwarf\" title=\"Imcando dwarf\">Imcando</a>, knowing the only hope for Avarrocka lied in the <a href=\"/w/Shield_of_Arrav_(artefact)\" title=\"Shield of Arrav (artefact)\">mythical shield</a> they possesed. He stood before the <a href=\"/w/Imcando_chief\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Imcando chief\">Imcando chief</a>, and recounted his second dream of Zemouregal. The chief relinquished possession of the shield at last, bestowing it to Arrav, who after thanking the chief set out for Avarrocka once more.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Arrav's_Fate\">Arrav's Fate</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/Arrav?section=9&amp;veaction=edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: Arrav&#039;s Fate\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/w/Arrav?action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Arrav&#039;s Fate\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/w/File:Lores_and_Histories_-_The_Legend_of_Arrav_(4).png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/Lores_and_Histories_-_The_Legend_of_Arrav_%284%29.png/300px-Lores_and_Histories_-_The_Legend_of_Arrav_%284%29.png?99fa5\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"270\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/Lores_and_Histories_-_The_Legend_of_Arrav_%284%29.png?99fa5 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"442\" data-file-height=\"398\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/w/File:Lores_and_Histories_-_The_Legend_of_Arrav_(4).png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Arrav fighting Zemouregal.</div></div></div>\n<p>He returned to <a href=\"/w/Varrock\" title=\"Varrock\">Avarrocka</a> to see an army massing to defend the town.

The two forces clashed and the conflict was bloody. Arrav eventually broke through towards Zemouregal, and engaged him in one on one combat. Even with the shield, Arrav was no match for the <a href=\"/w/Mahjarrat\" title=\"Mahjarrat\">mahjarrat</a>, whose physical strength far surpassed that of a human. Realising that he would not be able to defeat Zemouregal and that his doom was at hand, he cast the shield away in hope that someone else might use its powers to carry the day. Tendrils of oily smoke crept from Zemouregal's hands and twisted around Arrav, clutching him tight. For a few moments Arrav struggled then finally he was still. Arrav was dead; however, the shield which he had thrown in desperation had been taken up by the grandson of a town elder, who used its power to destroy Zemouregal's army.

A statue of Arrav can be found in the [[Heroes' Guild]] next to the statue of [[Camorra]]. During his lifetime, Arrav was also known as Arrav of Avarrocka, Curse of Goblins, Hunter of the White Stag, and Child of Sun and Moon.{{CiteLore|url=https://www.runescape.com/lore/the-legend-of-arrav|title=The Legend of Arrav|sectitle=A Curse in the Land of Dreams|name=A Curse in the Land of Dreams}} After completion of the [[Shield of Arrav]] [[quest]], his [[Shield of Arrav (artefact)|shield]] can be found on display in [[Varrock Museum]]. His battle axe can be found on display in the [[Outpost]] after completion of [[Making History]].{{CiteNPC|npc=Outpost{{!}}Large Display|loc=Making History|quote=Next is a battle axe, its card reads: 'The Axe of Arrav, left behind by accident before he journeyed on his quest for the shield to save the people of Avarrocka'.}}\n\n==The Legend of Arrav==\n{{Main|Transcript:The Legend of Arrav{{!}}The Legend of Arrav}}\n===Childhood===\n[[File:Lores and Histories - The Legend of Arrav (1).png|thumb|Arrav fighting [[goblins]].]]\nArrav was born near what is now known as [[Varrock]] at some point in the [[Fourth Age]]; no record of his birth or parents exists. A group of travellers seeking sanctuary from [[goblin]]s and [[ogre]]s found him as a child while following the [[River Lum]].<!--Inferred, though far more likely than the salve.--> The [[Elders of Avarrocka|elders of the tribe]] saw him as a good omen, and set up camp at this place, naming it Avarrocka. Arrav was raised as their own; he was taught to [[Hunter|hunt]], [[Farming|farm]], and even kill for times were cruel. He was described as unusually tall for someone so young, with dark eyes, fair hair and skin, and a kind smile.{{CiteLore|url=https://www.runescape.com/lore/the-legend-of-arrav|title=The Legend of Arrav|sectitle=Childhood of a Hero|name=Childhood of a Hero}}\n\nTen years passed, and the adults of the tribe reckoned Arrav to be around twelve years of age, yet he was still unnamed. As such the elders decided to send the child on a quest to find a name. After a number of days of travel, he discovered an encampment of goblins that planned to attack Avarrocka at night. As the goblins saw him they attacked, screaming \"''arrav''\", a word from their language. The goblins were defeated by Arrav, who after returning to Avarrocka and recounting the tale was thenceforth known by the name of \"''Arrav''\". As Arrav grew, so did Avarrocka.{{NamedRef|Childhood of a Hero}}\n\n===Zemouregal's threat===\nOne night Arrav visited the Land of Dreams wherein he encountered [[Zemouregal]], who threatened Arrav and his town of [[Varrock|Avarrocka]]. In fright he consulted with the [[Elders of Avarrocka]], who decided the encounter was a bad omen and that Arrav could not remain in Avarrocka. It was at this time that the eldest of the elders who recounted a tale from his youth of a fabulous shield, a shield that did not belong to this [[Gielinor|world]] and whose whereabouts was unknown. The elders thus concocted what they deemed an impossible quest to find the shield and sent Arrav away.{{NamedRef|A Curse in the Land of Dreams}}\n\n===A strange encounter===\nArrav set out to the west, and soon came upon a strange house surrounded by mist. Unafraid, he entered the house and beheld three men heatedly arguing around a table; the language they spoke was unfamiliar, yet he could somehow understand it. The interlocutors, who took no notice of Arrav, seemed to be in a dispute about the ownership of the house they were standing in. One figure complained the others had crept in whilst he slept. Arrav noticed several other smaller figures huddled in the shadows. The speech of the place troubled Arrav, who decided to continue on his way.{{CiteLore|url=https://www.runescape.com/lore/the-legend-of-arrav|title=The Legend of Arrav|sectitle=An Encounter Most Strange}}\n\n===Meeting the Imcando===\nArrav continued his travels, eventually coming across the [[Imcando dwarf|Imcando dwarves]]. The Imcando feigned ignorance of the shield when asked, though Arrav was not fooled. Arrav stayed with the Imcando for many days, attempting to gain their trust and perhaps information about the shield. During this respite, Arrav became accustomed to dwarven practices, learning their ways of [[Mining]] and [[Smithing]]. In due time the [[Imcando chief|leader of the Imcando]] summoned Arrav, asking why he sought the fabled shield. Arrav explained  the threat [[Zemouregal]] posed to his town, though in vain: the Imcando feared Arrav and his elders were being manipulated, and that his presense would only alert Zemouregal of their settlement's presence. Thus, with a heavy heart, he was sent away.{{CiteLore|url=https://www.runescape.com/lore/the-legend-of-arrav|title=The Legend of Arrav|sectitle=A Meeting with the Imcando}}\n\n===As an outcast===\nThough the Imcando had welcomed him and told him they held the shield, he could do nothing but hope the shield could be found elsewhere. However, in all the places he travelled, few knew of the shield, and those that spoke with him paled from his presence at the mention of [[Zemouregal]]. And so, Arrav became an outcast, a wanderer with no home. His spirits nearly broken, he entered a cave in which he thought he might spend the rest of his days. This cave was not empty, and he found himself assaulted by a terrible beast, with great talons. The battle lasted two days, until at last light on the second day Arrav's sword reflected the setting sun, blinding the beast which he then slayed. Standing over his fallen foe, Arrav perceived that he was on a ruinous path and astray from his quest. Leaving this fell place, he set out for [[Varrock|Avarrocka]].{{CiteLore|url=https://www.runescape.com/lore/the-legend-of-arrav|title=The Legend of Arrav|sectitle=A Battle of the Soul}}\n\n===The burning of Avarrocka===\nAs Arrav approached [[Varrock|Avarrocka]], he saw a billowing column of blackened smoke rising from the horizon. Rushing forward, he arrived only to find Avarrocka burned to the ground. In the smouldering remains of the town he encountered goblins, who had razed the place. Searching to the east of the town he found a band of surviving townspeople, and gathering the strongest men, he prepared a counter-attack. Before the attack commenced, he looked upon a comrade, filled with rage, and realised the assault would only cause a perpetual loop of violence and suffering. He took a stand, spoke loudly to the goblins and offered them peace, to which they accepted. The rebuilding of Avarrocka commenced.{{CiteLore|url=https://www.runescape.com/lore/the-legend-of-arrav|title=The Legend of Arrav|sectitle=Avarrocka burnt}}\n\n===Another dream and the shield given===\nWith the town rebuilt and busier than ever before, Arrav grew ever more restless. Two years past before he encountered [[Zemouregal]] once more in the Land of Dream; this time Zemouregal threatened not only to destroy Avarrocka but all his people wherever they may be. Following this portent, Arrav left [[Varrock|Avarrocka]] a second time.{{CiteLore|url=https://www.runescape.com/lore/the-legend-of-arrav|title=The Legend of Arrav|sectitle=The Curse Renewed}}\n\nArrav returned to the [[Imcando dwarf|Imcando]], knowing the only hope for Avarrocka lied in the [[Shield of Arrav (artefact)|mythical shield]] they possesed. He stood before the [[Imcando chief]], and recounted his second dream of Zemouregal. The chief relinquished possession of the shield at last, bestowing it to Arrav, who after thanking the chief set out for Avarrocka once more.{{CiteLore|url=https://www.runescape.com/lore/the-legend-of-arrav|title=The Legend of Arrav|sectitle=The Shield Given}}\n\n===Arrav's Fate===\n[[File:Lores and Histories - The Legend of Arrav (4).png|thumb|Arrav fighting Zemouregal.]]\nHe returned to [[Varrock|Avarrocka]] to see an army massing to defend the town. He went before the [[Elders of Avarrocka|elders]] and presented the shield, and then rested in preparation for the conflict to come.\n\nAs the sun rose, a shadow stretched from one end of the horizon to the other, moving forward: [[Zemouregal|Zemouregal's]] army had come. The two forces clashed and the conflict was bloody. Arrav eventually broke through towards Zemouregal, and engaged him in one on one combat. Even with the shield, Arrav was no match for the [[mahjarrat]], whose physical strength far surpassed that of a human. Realising that he would not be able to defeat Zemouregal and that his doom was at hand, he cast the shield away in hope that someone else might use its powers to carry the day. Tendrils of oily smoke crept from Zemouregal's hands and twisted around Arrav, clutching him tight. For a few moments Arrav struggled then finally he was still. Arrav was dead; however, the shield which he had thrown in desperation had been taken up by the grandson of a town elder, who used its power to destroy Zemouregal's army. Standing alone, Zemouregal was forced to retreat, but not before taking with him Arrav's body, which he reanimated: Arrav thus became one of Zemouregal's undead minions. {{CiteLore|url=https://www.runescape.com/lore/the-legend-of-arrav|title=The Legend of Arrav|sectitle=Arrav's Fate Fulfilled}}\n\n==Shield of Arrav==\n{{Main|Shield of Arrav}}\nArrav's shield became a prized possesion of the [[Varrock Museum|royal museum]] of [[Varrock]] for 150 years; however in the year 143 of the [[Fifth Age]] members of the [[Phoenix Gang]] broke into the museum and stole the shield. The ruler at the time, [[King Roald II]], placed a 1200 gold bounty for the return of the shield to no avail.{{CiteNPC|npc=A R Wright|loc=Book (Shield of Arrav)|quote=For over 150 years it was the prize piece in the royal museum of Varrock. However, in the year 143 of the fifth age a gang of thieves called the Phoenix Gang broke into the museum and stole the shield in a daring raid. As a result, the current ruler, King Roald, put a 1200 gold bounty (a massive sum of money in those days) on the return of the shield, hoping that one of the culprits would betray his fellows out of greed. This tactic did not work...}}\n\nSometime later, a band of discontented Phoenix Gang members mutinied and branched off into a separate gang, the so-called [[Black Arm Gang]]. During this process the shield was broken into two pieces, with one piece remaining with the Phoenix Gang and the other with the Black Arm Gang.{{CiteNPC |npc=Straven|quote=About five years ago we had a massive fight in our gang and the shield got broken in half during that fight. Shortly after the fight some gang members decided they didn't want to be part of our gang anymore. So they split off to form their own gang. The Black Arm Gang. On their way out they looted what treasures they could from us - which included one of the halves of the shield. We've been rivals with the Black Arms ever since.|loc=Shield of Arrav}}\n\nDuring the [[Shield of Arrav]] [[quest]], players must retrieve both pieces of the shield and return them to the [[Varrock Museum]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Varrock Museum display 24 (shield).png|The [[Shield of Arrav (artefact)|Shield of Arrav]], as displayed in [[Varrock Museum]].\nFile:Large display (1).png|Arrav's battle axe, as displayed in the [[Outpost]] museum, next to [[Wally]]'s helm and [[Randas]]' boots.\nFile:Statue of a warrior (Arrav).png|The statue of the hero, Arrav, as seen in the Heroes' Guild.\n\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*During his travels before finding the [[Imcando dwarf|Imcando dwarves]], he came across a house in the mist, the figures he comes across seemingly allude to [[Guthix]], [[Saradomin]], and [[Zamorak]], and a number of other figures that could represent other minor [[Gods]]. Their argument reflects Zamorak and Saradomin breaking the [[Edicts of Guthix]] and regaining influence whilst Guthix slept.\n*Arrav’s shield remains depicted on the official coins of Varrock to this day as testament to his greatness.{{CiteGodLetter|issue=13|letter=15|title=Guthix Maintains|url={{fullurl:Transcript:Guthix Maintains}}}}\n*He is referenced in a letter from the [[Wise Old Man]] to [[Thurgo]] the Imcando dwarf.{{CiteNPC|npc=Dionysius|loc=Old man's message|quote=Following your request, I have spend some time re-reading the relevant scrolls in the Library of Varrock.

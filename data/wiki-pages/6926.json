It had long been at war with the emirate of <a href=\"/w/Al_Kharid\" title=\"Al Kharid\">Al Kharid</a>, aiming to conquer territories in the north of the desert, but has been unable to do so in part due to the harsh climate.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The two powers are at peace now, but hostilities still have not subsided and could easily flare up again.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> In fact, Spymaster <a href=\"/w/Osman\" title=\"Osman\">Osman</a> of Al Kharid has agents inside the city causing civil unrest and he claims he would be 'lynched on sight' should he set foot inside Menaphos or <a href=\"/w/Sophanem\" title=\"Sophanem\">Sophanem</a> and that the Menaphites would be very interested in extracting 'delicate information' from him and punishing him for his actions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Despite the continuing hostilities, attempts have been made to improve relations, such as the construction of bridges over the <a href=\"/w/River_Elid\" title=\"River Elid\">River Elid</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Recently, a particular group of Menaphites in the service of <a href=\"/w/Amascut\" title=\"Amascut\">Amascut</a>, the Devourer, attempted to overthrow the Pharaoh, for which they were exiled.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The city closed its gates when the plagues began spreading in the neighbouring city of <a href=\"/w/Sophanem\" title=\"Sophanem\">Sophanem</a>, allowing nobody in or out.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Although the plagues were later proved to be limited and non-contagious, Menaphos still remains inaccessible, with Coenus and his men even going as far as to attack the <a href=\"/w/High_Priest_(Sophanem)\" title=\"High Priest (Sophanem)\">High Priest of Sophanem</a> and his delegation, who approached the gates to parlay. The city is heavily guarded on all sides and cannot be entered by conventional means. A subterranean passage from Sophanem exists, but it is infested with the dangerous Sect of Scabaras and a large chasm separates the Menaphite from the Sophanite side.\n</p><p>During the quarantine, word spread that the <a href=\"/w/Slave_(Sophanem)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Slave (Sophanem)\">Sophanite slaves</a> did not have to labour, causing their Menaphite counterparts to rebel against the authorities.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> The situation threatened to escalate, but Coenus brutally repressed the protests in the imperial and merchant districts. The slaves yet remain rebellious in the slums and part of the docks.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> The sudden quarantine also left many Sophanites trapped in Menaphos, even as Sophanem itself lifted its own quarantine. One of Osman's agents, <a href=\"/w/Maisa\" title=\"Maisa\">Maisa</a>, made a deal with an adventurer in the service of Sophanem that she would inform the Sophanites they could go back home safely in return for the adventurer's summoning Osman to come to her in person in order to help her get out of the city. Despite the dangers, this plan succeeded: Maisa helped the Sophanites get out of Sophanem and the city established trade with Al Kharid as part of Osman's plans to instil hostilities between the twin cities.\n</p><p>Apart from the slave revolts, the quarantine has led to a significant reduction of Menaphos's interaction with the rest of the world. For example, the librarian <a href=\"/w/Aristarchus\" title=\"Aristarchus\">Aristarchus</a> is sojourning in <a href=\"/w/Pollnivneach\" title=\"Pollnivneach\">Pollnivneach</a>, unable to return, and <a href=\"/w/Shiratti_the_Custodian\" title=\"Shiratti the Custodian\">Shiratti</a>, curatrix of <a href=\"/w/Nardah\" title=\"Nardah\">Nardah</a>'s Temple of Elidinis, has long awaited the arrival of

It is not yet accessible due to the inhabitants' fear of the plague in neighbouring [[Sophanem]]. Little is known about the city except that it consists of four districts: the imperial district, the merchants' district, the docks, and the slums. Its chief gatekeeper is [[Coenus]], a brutal and ruthless man.\n\nUnlike its neighbour, the solemn City of the Dead, where deceased Menaphites are laid to rest, Menaphos is known as a grand city of culture and wealth. It is known to contain a library whose scholars travel afar to gather knowledge.  Moreover, in ancient times, its philosophers were able to figure out that the planet [[RuneScape]] is a sphere, for they thought it to be the most perfect shape. Additionally, they used evidence provided by sailing ships to back up this claim, which was later proven correct.{{CitePostbag|issue=4|letter=Letter 1|author=Professor Gronigen}}\n\n==History==\nLittle is known about the history of Menaphos. It had long been at war with the emirate of [[Al Kharid]], aiming to conquer territories in the north of the desert, but has been unable to do so in part due to the harsh climate.{{CiteNPC|npc=Osman|loc=Contact!|quote=Our two kingdoms were at war with one another for centuries. They tried to expand their kingdom northwards many times over the years, but we held them off. The desert is a great equalizer{{sic}}. It's very difficult to move large armies about in it, particularly if you don't have ready access to water.}} The two powers are at peace now, but hostilities still have not subsided and could easily flare up again.{{CiteNPC|npc=Scout (Shantay Pass)|loc=The General's Shadow|quote=The fighting in the desert has come to a stop. However, there is still much distrust between Menaphos and Al Kharid. It seems like it would be possible to reignite the war if needed.}} In fact, Spymaster [[Osman]] of Al Kharid has agents inside the city causing civil unrest and he claims he would be 'lynched on sight' should he set foot inside Menaphos or [[Sophanem]] and that the Menaphites would be very interested in extracting 'delicate information' from him and punishing him for his actions.{{CiteNPC|npc=Osman|loc=Contact!|quote=I've had my people instigate a bit of civil unrest. Officially our cities may be at peace, but I have some old scores to settle first.}} Despite the continuing hostilities, attempts have been made to improve relations, such as the construction of bridges over the [[River Elid]].{{CiteNews|author=Chris J|url=https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/desert-month-finale|title=Desert Month Finale|newsdate=26 April 2005|quote=A bridge across the River Elid has recently been constructed, yet another signal of the warming relations between the Kharidians and the Menaphites, opening up even more areas in our huge desert expansion.}}\n\nRecently, a particular group of Menaphites in the service of [[Amascut]], the Devourer, attempted to overthrow the Pharaoh, for which they were exiled.{{CiteNPC|npc=Menaphite Leader|loc=The Feud|quote=We are the chosen, exiled from Menaphos for trying to overthrow the Pharaoh. Loyal servants of Amascut the Devourer, God of Destruction. We are regrouping to launch another offensive against the thrall of Tumeken, using Pollnivneach as a spawning ground for revolution!}}\n\nThe city closed its gates when the plagues began spreading in the neighbouring city of [[Sophanem]], allowing nobody in or out.{{CiteNPC|npc=Nathifa|loc=Contact!|quote=Well, it all started the day that the plagues broke out here. I had gone into Menaphos in the morning to get some flour and chocolate powder and, when it came time for me to return, the gates were shut.}} Although the plagues were later proved to be limited and non-contagious, Menaphos still remains inaccessible, with Coenus and his men even going as far as to attack the [[High Priest (Sophanem)|High Priest of Sophanem]] and his delegation, who approached the gates to parlay. The city is heavily guarded on all sides and cannot be entered by conventional means. A subterranean passage from Sophanem exists, but it is infested with the dangerous Sect of Scabaras and a large chasm separates the Menaphite from the Sophanite side.\n\nDuring the quarantine, word spread that the [[Slave (Sophanem)|Sophanite slaves]] did not have to labour, causing their Menaphite counterparts to rebel against the authorities.{{CiteNPC|npc=Nathifa|loc=Contact!|quote=Well, word must have travelled back to the slaves that their fellow slaves in Sophanem no longer had to work and so they rioted.}} The situation threatened to escalate, but Coenus brutally repressed the protests in the imperial and merchant districts. The slaves yet remain rebellious in the slums and part of the docks.{{CiteNPC|npc=Nathifa|loc=Contact!|quote=It was, but Coenus, chief gate keeper of the city, stamped the revolt down fairly fast... and quite brutally. [...] No, it was only stopped in the imperial and merchant quarters of the city. There is still trouble in the slums and in parts of the docks.}} The sudden quarantine also left many Sophanites trapped in Menaphos, even as Sophanem itself lifted its own quarantine. One of Osman's agents, [[Maisa]], made a deal with an adventurer in the service of Sophanem that she would inform the Sophanites they could go back home safely in return for the adventurer's summoning Osman to come to her in person in order to help her get out of the city. Despite the dangers, this plan succeeded: Maisa helped the Sophanites get out of Sophanem and the city established trade with Al Kharid as part of Osman's plans to instil hostilities between the twin cities.\n\nApart from the slave revolts, the quarantine has led to a significant reduction of Menaphos's interaction with the rest of the world. For example, the librarian [[Aristarchus]] is sojourning in [[Pollnivneach]], unable to return, and [[Shiratti the Custodian|Shiratti]], curatrix of [[Nardah]]'s Temple of Elidinis, has long awaited the arrival of a new priestess from Menaphos to lead the temple.{{CiteGeneral|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090522005839/http://www.runescape.com/kbase/viewarticle.ws?article_id=2628|quote=As the curator of the town's Temple of Elidinis, and in the absence of a priestess, Shiratti is responsible for maintaining the town's religious attitudes.

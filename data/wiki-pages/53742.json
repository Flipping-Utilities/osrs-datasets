These rates are unknown, except for the following crops:{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Kieren|url=https://twitter.com/JagexKieren/status/905855565137633287|date=7 September 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/HmrkK|archivedate=28 May 2020|quote=So with the release of Ultracompost I figured I'd explain how compost affects crops dying. Sorry it is very word heavy! Fire any questions:).|notes=''Note:'' The image in the tweet says the ultracompost multiplier is 1/7, but later in the thread it is corrected to 1/10. Additionally, the image says \"Fruit Trees have 4 chances of becoming diseased\" but it's actually five, as can be seen in [[Apple tree seed]] for example. Therefore his statement that \"fruit trees have a 96.9% chance of surviving\" if using ultracompost is incorrect -- it is actually 96.15%. Additionally, collected data shows that it is overwhelmingly likely that when creating the graphic, Kieren adjusted the denominator by one to account for a random roll of 0-127, but did not also adjust the numerator, hence the difference in table by +1.}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Plant\n!title=\"Evidence suggests that Mod Kieren's rates may be referring to a maximum disease roll and may be off by 1/128. The numbers above are based on the assumption that a valid disease roll ranges from 0 up to and including this maximum disease roll.

Supercompost and ultracompost can also be used before or after.\n\nWatering allotment, flower, and hops patches with a [[watering can]] reduces the risk of disease occurring at the end of that growth cycle.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1206382608466268160|date=16 December 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.is/OzPlm|archivedate=16 December 2019|quote=[Does watering crops eliminate chance of disease for one grow cycle stage or just reduce it?] It just reduces it. - [Got it. In that case, how much does watering reduce chance of disease?] There isn't a formula as far as I know - the dev who made the skill just set different numbers.}} During the next growth cycle, the plant changes from being watered back to normal and has a higher risk for disease once more, unless it is watered again. Only allotment, flower, and hops patches may be watered.\n\n==Eliminating disease risk==\nPlanting different [[Flower seed|flowers]] or a [[scarecrow]] provides protection from disease to a variety of crops in allotment patches once the flower is fully grown.\n\nThe special herb patches unlocked by completing [[My Arm's Big Adventure]] and [[Making Friends with My Arm]] are immune to disease, although herb yields may still be increased by treating the patches with super/ultracompost.\n\nGaining 50% [[Hosidius]] [[favour]] will eliminate the disease risk entirely of the Hosidius allotment, herb, and flower patches.\n\nWith the elite tier of the [[Falador Diary]] complete, the tree patch in [[Falador Park]] will no longer become diseased.\n\nOtherwise, the only way to eliminate disease risk entirely from all other patches is to pay one of the [[Farmer (NPC)|farmers]] near the [[Farming/Patch locations|farming patch]] to watch over it and ensure that it grows to completion. Payment must be in the exact form requested. For instance, a farmer does not accept 5 [[apples]] in lieu of a [[basket of apples]]. However, farmers do accept [[note]]d payment. Note that farmers require separate payment for each allotment patch.\n\nThe [[Belladonna patch|belladonna]] and [[Mushroom patch|mushroom]] patches do not have farmers available to oversee them, however. While farmers can oversee allotment patches, they cannot prevent the nearby herb or flower patches from becoming diseased.\n\n[[Poison ivy bush]]es are immune to disease. Farmers will not accept payment to watch over a poison ivy bush.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Farming]]"}

Zamorak, the most powerful [[Mahjarrat]] general in Zaros' service, wanted to usurp Zaros' leadership of his vast empire and the [[Mahjarrat]]. When he, by chance, got hold of the Staff of Armadyl, he decided to make his move. With his close Mahjarrat followers [[Hazeel]] and [[Zemouregal]], as well as the vampyre [[Lord Drakan]] and others, he plotted Zaros' downfall. His allies would engage Zaros' bodyguards while Zamorak fought Zaros himself. \n\n==History==\n===Obtaining the Staff of Armadyl===\n[[Valdez]], a Saradominist explorer, stumbled upon the [[Staff of Armadyl]].{{CiteNPC|npc=Valdez|loc=Curse of the Empty Lord|quote= I am unsure who had built [the temple], or why they had left it seemingly abandoned, but inside I located a great treasure...

I let Lord Zamorak know that there was some drunken fool with an artefact of incredible power that could probably be bought off with a few jewels and trinkets, ... and he escorted me to the tavern and made the purchase there and then.}} \n\n===Saradominist Intervention===\n[[Lennissa]], a Saradominist spy,{{CiteNPC|npc=Lennissa|loc=Curse of the Empty Lord|quote=Let me see... I had been working as a spy for my Lord Saradomin, amongst the forces of... the Empty Lord.}} found out about the sale and recognized the threat that Zaros would pose if he came into possession of the staff.{{CiteNPC|npc=Lennissa|loc=Curse of the Empty Lord|quote=If he had taken possession of this god-weapon, then his power would have been so great that he could have overthrown all on this world, and made it into his own image!}} Lennissa decided to inform her superior [[Dhalak]], a Saradominist mage, about the weapon,{{CiteNPC|npc=Lennissa|loc=Curse of the Empty Lord|quote=I went immediately to my comrade Dhalak, the mage, and told him that a message had come to the lair offering this weapon for sale!}} believing that Saradomin would contact Armadyl and see to the return of the weapon once he was informed.{{CiteNPC|npc=Lennissa|loc=Curse of the Empty Lord|quote=I knew that as soon as my Lord Saradomin heard this, he would contact Armadyl to inform them of the theft, and the matter would have been resolved quickly and discreetly.}} Dhalak was supposed to pass the information on to Saradomin himself, but he instead enchanted the staff so that Zaros could not detect it.{{CiteNPC|npc=Dhalak|loc=Curse of the Empty Lord|quote=Indeed I did. To my eternal shame, I decided that I would assist Zamorak and his henchmen in their battle, by secretly casting a spell of concealment upon the staff so that ... they might use it secretly against their master.}} Dhalak knew about Zamorak's intention to betray Zaros, and he thought that the internal conflict caused by Zamorak's betrayal would benefit Saradomin.{{CiteNPC|npc=Dhalak|loc=Curse of the Empty Lord|quote=Now, as powerful, long-lived and evil as they were, they were still just mortal, and I made the decision that it would be of benefit to my Lord Saradomin for his mightiest rival to be distracted by such internal conflicts}} Not even Zamorak knew that Dhalak helped to conceal the staff.{{CiteNPC|npc=Dhalak|loc=Curse of the Empty Lord|quote=No, nobody except myself, and now you, knew that I cast such a spell....}}\n\n===Battle with Zaros===\nAfter obtaining the staff, Zamorak and his most loyal followers - Hazeel, Drakan, Thammaron, Zemouregal, and a human called [[Viggora]] - made plans to attack Zaros in his throne room.\n{{CiteNPC|npc=Viggora|loc=Curse of the Empty Lord|quote=So anyway, Lord Zamorak and his most trusted compatriots, namely myself, Hazeel, Drakan, Thammaron and Zemouregal made plans to overthrow our lord using the god-weapon, and by pledging allegiance to Zamorak as our master, were each to be given a large piece of land as our own in return.}} The [[Dragon Rider]] [[Apropos]] also chose to side with Zamorak,{{CiteText|text=Ablenkian's escape|author=Ablenkian|loc=4|quote=I did not betray our lord like Apropos did}} but it is unknown if she participated in the battle.\n\nWhile the followers of Zamorak kept Zaros and his guards busy with their attacks, Zamorak outmaneuvered Zaros and managed to stab him in the back with the Staff of Armadyl.{{CiteNPC|npc=Viggora|loc=Curse of the Empty Lord|quote=While we distracted the Empty Lord with our feints and attacks, and kept his bodyguards busy, Lord Zamorak outflanked him, unsheathed the staff and plunged it into his back!}} This weakened Zaros, but he still seemed to be much more powerful than Zamorak.{{CiteNPC|npc=Viggora|loc=Curse of the Empty Lord|quote=Even with the weapon of a god embedded in his back, he fought on, and with each blow our victory seemed less and less certain...}} With the staff still impaled in his back he seized Zamorak by the throat and lifted him into the air. Zamorak would have been killed, but somehow Zaros stumbled and fell onto his back. After that, the Staff of Armadyl crossed Zaros' body and impaled Zamorak without leaving it.{{CiteNPC|npc=Viggora|loc=Curse of the Empty Lord|quote=You can call it what you want, but as the Empty Lords hands wrapped tightly around Zamorak's throat, Lord Zamorak, kicking and screaming defiantly and radiant in his anger until the very last, plunged towards the Empty Lord, who seemed to lose his footing slightly, and fell in such a way so that the staff plunged deeper into his body, but also impaled Lord Zamorak with it at the same time...}} Unexpectedly, it acted as a conduit that transferred Zaros' divine power to Zamorak.{{CiteNPC|npc=Viggora|loc=Curse of the Empty Lord|quote=Zamorak stood over the Empty Lord who was slowly... fading from existence... And as he faded, it seemed as though... It almost seemed as though Zamorak became more real, more solid than he had been before...}} As Zaros disappeared, he cast a curse on all those who helped Zamorak bring the staff to Zaros' castle.{{CiteNPC|npc=Viggora|loc=Curse of the Empty Lord|quote=And as the Empty Lord faded from this world completely, I heard his voice, almost a whisper upon the wind, cursing all who had helped Zamorak in his victory, which as you now tell me seems to have been all who were responsible for the staff ending up in Zamorak's hands at the castle.}} \n\n==Aftermath==\nIn response to Zamorak's attack on Zaros, the other gods banished Zamorak. However, Zamorak was able to eventually return, stronger and as a god himself.{{CiteNPC|npc=Viggora|loc=Curse of the Empty Lord|quote=It was then that the other gods appeared and banished Zamorak from the world completely for daring to kill one of their kind, although as it turned out it didn't quite work out that way for them, when he returned stronger than ever, a god himself.}} After his return, the [[God Wars]] began.{{CiteNPC|npc=Viggora|loc=Curse of the Empty Lord|quote=But the god wars were another story entirely...}}\n\nThose who were cursed by Zaros were bound to remain as ghosts on Gielinor. However, it seems that not all were affected, as the vampyres and Mahjarrat that aided Zamorak were not transformed into ghosts. The reason for this is unknown.{{CiteNPC|npc=Viggora|loc=Curse of the Empty Lord|quote=Who knows why the curse fell as it did? Perhaps as a mere human I was more susceptible to it, when they were not. Perhaps they too are cursed, but their life spans are so long that it will be millennia before they feel it upon them.}}\n\nAlthough [[Saradomin]] and Zamorak warred with each other, they formed an alliance to crush the Zarosian forces. With each battle, the Zarosians were pushed further and further into the [[Kharidian Desert]] as they lost their lands. Eventually, the Saradominists and Zamorakians managed to imprison [[Azzanadra]] at the [[Jaldraocht Pyramid]]. With their greatest hero incapacitated, some of the remaining Zarosians settled in the desert.{{CiteNPC |npc=Eblis |loc=Desert Treasure |quote=Then came the betrayal. Our god was banished, leaving us helpless to our fates. [...] The spiteful Saradomin and pathetic Zamorak warred with each other, but the hatred they had for each other was as nothing to the hatred they held towards us! With each battle they waged, we lost more and more land, unable to fight on all fronts, and were pushed further and further South into this gods-forsaken desert. Our greatest hero, Azzanadra, was finally trapped in a strange stone structure to the South of here, and bound within by terrible powers... And with that our lands, our homes, our very lives were stolen from us! Too weak to reclaim what was rightfully ours, we made our homes here, knowing that someday Azzanadra will return with his magnificent power, and bring us back to our former glory...}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Battles}}"}

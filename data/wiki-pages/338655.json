Since they are always aggressive, the player can stand still in the same location. They will however become unaggressive after the player remains for 10 minutes in the area, after which the player needs to reset this timer by walking away a small distance.\n</p><p>It is worth noting that the Ammonite crabs cannot be damaged by the <a href=\"/w/Dwarf_Multicannon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Dwarf Multicannon\">Dwarf Multicannon</a>. Because of this, an alternative would be fighting <a href=\"/w/Rock_Crab\" title=\"Rock Crab\">Rock Crabs</a>, which have 50 Hitpoints compared to the Ammonite Crabs.

To prevent regenerating health, flick <a href=\"/w/Rapid_Heal\" title=\"Rapid Heal\">Rapid Heal</a> about every 50 seconds, since one hitpoint is passively regained every minute and Rapid Heal will reset this timer. Because of this, the Nightmare Zone requires slightly more attention than fighting crabs.\n</p><p>Lastly, players may wish to idle <a href=\"/w/Slayer_tasks\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Slayer tasks\">Slayer tasks</a>, simultaneously training combat skills and <a href=\"/w/Slayer\" title=\"Slayer\">Slayer</a>. Depending on the task received, the monsters might be <a href=\"/w/Safespot\" title=\"Safespot\">safespottable</a>, causing the player to take no damage at all if done well.

This means the player will fish until either their inventory is full or they run out of [[raw karambwanji]] bait. Raising [[kitten]]s while fishing is also a low effort way of earning [[death runes]].\n\n{{SCP|Woodcutting}} '''[[Woodcutting]]''' - Chopping trees that grant the most experience per log is the best way of idling this skill. With level 60 Woodcutting and 75% Hosidius [[favour]], the player gains access to the [[Woodcutting Guild]]. This guild has a [[bank chest]] nearby high-level trees, allowing fast disposal of an inventory full of logs. [[Sulliuscep]]s also offer great idle experience, but require the player to pay attention when moving through the [[Tar Swamp|swamp]].\n\n{{SCP|Magic}} '''[[Magic]]''' - Can be idled without combat via certain utility spells, most notably [[Enchant Crossbow Bolt]]. Casting this once will autocast it on sets of ten bolts up to 10 times. This method is however very expensive. Casting [[teleportation spells]], while not an idle activity, might be a more preferable non-combat way of training Magic. [[Plank Make]] becomes available at level 86, a cost-friendly spell that grants more overall experience than most other Magic spells. This spell autocasts until all [[log (disambiguation)|logs]] in the inventory are converted to [[plank]]s.\n\n{{SCP|Prayer}} '''[[Prayer]]''' - [[Bones]] can be offered to [[altar]]s as a mostly idle way of earning experience, as the player character slowly offers them one by one. The [[Gilded altar]] with lit [[incense burner]]s in the [[player-owned house]], and the [[Chaos temple (hut)|Chaos Altar]] in level 38 [[Wilderness]] offer 3.5 times the normal rate of burying the bone. The Chaos Altar furthermore effectively doubles this amount to 7 times, as it holds a repeating 50% chance per bone to not consume it when offering.\n\n{{SCP|Mining}} '''[[Mining]]''' - The [[Motherlode Mine]] provides decent experience and payout for relatively few interactions. [[Pay-dirt]] veins only have a 33% chance of depleting per ore mined, instead of the usual guaranteed chance to deplete.\n\n{{SCP|Firemaking}} '''[[Firemaking]]''' - Can only be somewhat idled by battling the [[Wintertodt]]. Note that this is a [[dangerous activity]] that can possibly kill the player. It is recommended to enable sound effects to be aware when damage is taken, as this will also interupt most actions. If aiming for experience, this should be played on one of the officially dedicated Wintertodt worlds. Otherwise, this should be attempted solo or with few other players, to maximise the rewards earned each round (up to 13,500 points).\n\n{{SCP|Agility}} '''[[Agility]]''' and {{SCP|Thieving}} '''[[Thieving]]''' - Can hardly be idled. Still, in both cases is possible to keep the mouse cursor on the same location without moving it, for example by continuously crossing the [[pressure pad]]s in the [[Brimhaven Agility Arena]] or pickpocketing trapped [[Knights of Ardougne]]. Note that most Agility and Thieving activities occassionally damage the player.\n\n{{SCP|Runecraft}} '''[[Runecraft]]''' - Cannot be idled well, as it requires running around a lot. From level 77, the player can craft [[blood rune|blood]] and [[soul rune]]s in [[Arceuus]], which is partly AFK as it involves mining [[dense essence block]]s. Making these runes is very profitable and also offers some Mining and Crafting experience.\n\n{{SCP|Construction}} '''[[Construction]]''' - Cannot be idled by conventional means, as building furniture is near instant. However, [[long bone]]s and [[curved bone]]s, which are rare drops from certain monsters, will provide passive Construction experience when handed in to [[Barlak]].\n\n===Combat skills===\nMonsters with high [[Hitpoints]] but low offensive [[combat stats]] are best fought when idling combat. [[Ammonite Crab]]s are the most notable for this, with 100 Hitpoints and only one level in every other combat stat. Since they are always aggressive, the player can stand still in the same location. They will however become unaggressive after the player remains for 10 minutes in the area, after which the player needs to reset this timer by walking away a small distance.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Ammonite crabs cannot be damaged by the [[Dwarf Multicannon]]. Because of this, an alternative would be fighting [[Rock Crab]]s, which have 50 Hitpoints compared to the Ammonite Crabs. These are found in large quantities in multi-combat areas, allowing optimal use of the cannon. The player would only need to refill the cannon every while, and re-enter the area when the crabs become docile.\n\nAnother common option is idling in the [[Nightmare Zone]], an activity that can even be done with multiple players. Players can spend a long time in this arena without ever taking damage from the bosses. They first bring down their Hitpoints to 1 with an [[Overload (Nightmare Zone|Overload potion]] and [[dwarven rock cake]]s, then chuck [[Absorption potion]]s to absorb a maximum of 1000 damage. Since enemies can only hit for one damage when the player has 1 health, and the absorption potions have no time limit, the player can absorb plenty of hits. To prevent regenerating health, flick [[Rapid Heal]] about every 50 seconds, since one hitpoint is passively regained every minute and Rapid Heal will reset this timer. Because of this, the Nightmare Zone requires slightly more attention than fighting crabs.\n\nLastly, players may wish to idle [[Slayer tasks]], simultaneously training combat skills and [[Slayer]]. Depending on the task received, the monsters might be [[safespot]]table, causing the player to take no damage at all if done well. They may also be unaggressive to the player, in which case players with decent Hitpoints will not need to worry about dying when not paying attention.\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 10 September 2015\n|update = Slayer Assignment Rework\n|change = Players will now stop retaliating after 20 minutes of idle combat.

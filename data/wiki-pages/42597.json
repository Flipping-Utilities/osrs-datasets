You may have as many game accounts as you like, but each account should only be used by the person who created it. All game accounts are the property of Jagex and players are only granted limited permission to use accounts. Nobody has our permission to sell accounts.</li>\n<li><b>Macroing and third-party software/hardware:</b> People also call this 'botting.' It means using software or hardware that can help you play the game with the software or hardware doing things for you that you should be doing yourself. Our games are meant to be played by humans - if you cheat, you are likely to be banned, even if it is the first time you have broken the rules.</li></ul>\n<p>Software that is not allowed includes anything that:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Tries to interact with our game worlds without logging in.</li>\n<li>Tries to look at or change the communications between your device and our game worlds.</li>\n<li>Performs things in-game for you that you're meant to be doing yourself.</li>\n<li>Changes parts of our game. Copying the code we use to run our games is not allowed. Using edited versions of our game code is not allowed. Other software that shows pages or content from our website(s) must not be used to go to our website unless the software follows all of our other rules.</li>\n<li>Repeatedly asks for information from our website or is extremely demanding on our website. Each page on our website should only load if you open the page yourself.</li>\n<li>Gets around the normal steps used to log in. Software should make sure you log in as normal to reach a game world.</li>\n<li>Hides or supports hiding any of the adverts on our website.</li>\n<li>Tries to make it easier to enter a busy game world than it would be for users not using the software.</li>\n<li>Has its own chat feature separate from our game chat that does not follow our rules. If the software has a chat function, then it should make it very clear to users that this chat is not part of our games and is not official, supported by, or moderated by Jagex Limited (\"Jagex\") This chat should still be moderated (just not by us), and the moderators should not allow chat that does not follow our rules set out on this page.

When players make an [[account]], they agree to be bound by the rules and to face punishment (i.e. a [[ban]] or a [[mute]]) if they do not abide by them.\n[[Jagex]]'s [[Customer Support]] team may apply a variety of sanctions against rule breakers, up to a permanent account ban. Lesser offences may result in a warning, temporary ban, or a temporary or permanent mute.\n\nThe [[RuneScape Forums]] operate under a set of slightly modified rules also called the Code of Conduct. Some sections of the rules are tailored and expanded upon to make them more suitable for the Forums. You can find more information about the Code of Conduct in RuneScape Forums. There are also specific rules tailored to each specific forum, called the \"Forum Specific Rules\", and they can be found by clicking on the link near the top of each forum.\n\nKeeping your account's offences to a minimum contributes to a greater chance of successfully becoming a [[Player Moderator]]. If you feel that someone is violating one of the Rules of RuneScape, you can [[report]] the offending player using the \"Report Abuse\" button below the [[chatbox]] on the lower-right hand side.\n\n'''Note:''' These rules were copied from the ''RuneScape'' website, but we cannot guarantee that they are accurate or up-to-date. Therefore, the rules given here cannot be taken as definitive, only those listed on the ''RuneScape'' website can. It is individual players' responsibility to ensure that they abide by Jagex's current rules and policies at all times in the game, on the RuneScape Forums, and everywhere else. Jagex rules are also enforced on this wiki, and any user who posts information or advice on how to break rules may be blocked from editing.\n\n==2021 rule updates==\nOn [[23 March]] [[2021]], rule ten was updated separately to include services alongside account trading e.g. training, quests and completing [[The Inferno]] for an [[infernal cape]]. However this does not include multi-player content where the player does not share their account - for instance employing the services of a [[Barbarian Assault]] team using in-game gold for a [[fighter torso]].\n\nOn [[2 September]] [[2021]], Jagex reworded and clarified the Rules of RuneScape on [https://www.jagex.com/en-GB/terms/rules-of-runescape their website]. It was mostly rewording of existing rules, however formerly ambiguous rules or \"grey areas\" were clarified as follows.\n* '''Buying/selling and sharing accounts:''' Players must not share, transfer or lend their account to anyone else. You may have as many game accounts as you like, but each account should only be used by the person who created it. All game accounts are the property of Jagex and players are only granted limited permission to use accounts. Nobody has our permission to sell accounts.\n* '''Macroing and third-party software/hardware:''' People also call this 'botting.' It means using software or hardware that can help you play the game with the software or hardware doing things for you that you should be doing yourself. Our games are meant to be played by humans - if you cheat, you are likely to be banned, even if it is the first time you have broken the rules.\n\nSoftware that is not allowed includes anything that:\n*Tries to interact with our game worlds without logging in.\n*Tries to look at or change the communications between your device and our game worlds.\n*Performs things in-game for you that you're meant to be doing yourself.\n*Changes parts of our game. Copying the code we use to run our games is not allowed. Using edited versions of our game code is not allowed. Other software that shows pages or content from our website(s) must not be used to go to our website unless the software follows all of our other rules.\n*Repeatedly asks for information from our website or is extremely demanding on our website. Each page on our website should only load if you open the page yourself.\n*Gets around the normal steps used to log in. Software should make sure you log in as normal to reach a game world.\n*Hides or supports hiding any of the adverts on our website.\n*Tries to make it easier to enter a busy game world than it would be for users not using the software.\n*Has its own chat feature separate from our game chat that does not follow our rules. If the software has a chat function, then it should make it very clear to users that this chat is not part of our games and is not official, supported by, or moderated by Jagex Limited (\"Jagex\") This chat should still be moderated (just not by us), and the moderators should not allow chat that does not follow our rules set out on this page. Silver or gold crowns should also only be used to identify moderators in the official game chat.\n*Uses any of the unacceptable features specifically banned in our Message About Unofficial Clients which can be found [https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/a-message-about-unofficial-clients?oldschool=1 here].\n\n\n==Updated rules==\n[[File:Report Abuse form.png|right|thumb|The current Report Abuse system.]]\nAs of [[22 October]] [[2015]] per the [[Update:Abyssal Bludgeon Buff#Updated Report Screen|Abyssal Bludgeon Buff]] update, [[Jagex]] has updated the Report Abuse menu, adding some options that were not previously offered in ''[[Old School RuneScape]]'', such as 'Offensive Name' and rewording others for consistency with Jagex's other products.\n\nThe updated rules are as followed:\n\n#Seriously offensive language\n#[[Scamming]]\n#Breaking real-world laws\n#[[Glitch|Exploiting a bug]] (bug abuse)\n#Staff impersonation\n#Encouraging rule breaking (all rules included)\n#[[Macroing]] or use of bots\n#Offensive account name\n#Advertising websites\n#Buying/selling accounts and services\n#Asking for or providing contact information (addresses, phone numbers, emails, etc.)\n#Solicitation\n#Player-run Games of Chance (such as [[Scams#Trust trading scams|trust trades]], [http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/forums.ws?380,381,129,65525537 commission staking], [[rsw:Dicing#Dice game|dicing]], and [[rsw:Gambling#Player-run gambling|gambling]]{{CiteForum|author=Mod Ronan|url=http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/forums.ws?380,381,129,65525537|title=Integrity Survey Followup|postdate=27 November 2014|archiveurl=https://archive.is/WCPI6|archivedate=16 July 2020|quote=As such from now we will be considering anyone being part of a commission staking friends chat (that is hosting, participating and advertising) as involved in real world trading.

Muling is the act of intentionally moving valuable items onto other accounts to prevent losing them when dying.\n\n==Old rules (27 Nov 2014 - 22 Oct 2015)==\n[[File:Report_Abuse_Interface.png|right|thumb|The Report Abuse system consisting of twelve rules from [[27 November]] [[2014]] to [[22 October]] [[2015]].]]\nOn [[27 November]] [[2014]], [[Jagex]] slightly modified the rules as follows:\n\n#Offensive language (includes spamming)\n#[[Item scamming]]\n#Password scamming\n#[[Glitch|Bug abuse]] (cheating)\n#[https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115001245149-Staff-Impersonation Jagex staff impersonation]\n#Encouraging others to break rules (all rules included)\n#[[Macroing]] (using third-party software like bots)\n#Advertising websites\n#[[Real world item trading]]\n#Asking for personal details (addresses, phone numbers, emails, etc.)\n#[http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/forums.ws?380,381,129,65525537 Player harassment]{{CiteForum|author=Mod Ronan|url=http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/forums.ws?380,381,129,65525537|title=Integrity Survey Followup|postdate=27 November 2014|archiveurl=https://archive.is/q2gjW|archivedate=16 July 2020|quote=Off the back of this, we have redesigned the report abuse screen to include a new option to report other players that are harassing you.|name=Player Harassment}}\n#Games of chance (such as [[Scams#Trust trading scams|trust trades]], [http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/forums.ws?380,381,129,65525537 commission staking], [[rsw:Dicing#Dice game|dicing]], and [[rsw:Gambling#Player-run gambling|gambling]]{{NamedRef|name=Commission Staking}})\n\n==Original rules==\n[[File:Old_Report_Abuse.png|right|thumb|The old Report Abuse in-game user interface listing 13 rules prior to [[27 November]] [[2014]].]]\nPrior to the [[Update:Integrity Survey Followup|Integrity Survey Followup]] update on [[27 November]] [[2014]], there were 15 rules. They were later reduced to 13, however.\n\nThe former rules include:\n#[http://services.runescape.com/m=rswiki/en/Inappropriate_language_or_behaviour Offensive language (includes spamming)] - You must not use any language that is offensive, racist or obscene.\n#[[Scams|Item scamming]] - You must not scam or deceive other [[players]].\n#[http://services.runescape.com/m=rswiki/en/Scamming Password scamming] - Asking for another player's password for any reason will not be tolerated.\n#[[Glitch|Bug abuse]] [http://services.runescape.com/m=rswiki/en/Knowingly_exploiting_a_bug (cheating)] - Any bugs found within the game must be reported to [[Jagex]] immediately.\n#[http://services.runescape.com/m=rswiki/en/Jagex_staff_impersonation Jagex staff impersonation] - You should not attempt to impersonate Jagex staff in any way.\n#[http://services.runescape.com/m=rswiki/en/Account_sharing_and_buying_or_selling_accounts Account sharing/trading] - Each account should only be used by '''ONE''' person.\n#[http://services.runescape.com/m=rswiki/en/Macroing_and_third-party_software Using third-party software like bots] (titled \"[[Macroing]]\" in-game) - You must not use other programs to gain an unfair advantage at the game.

Operating an RSPS without Jagex's consent, in some jurisdictions, constitutes copyright infringement. Jagex strongly discourages using a private server, due to the risks of malware and theft of personal information{{CiteTwitter|author=Jagex Support|url=https://twitter.com/JagexSupport/status/1276407486157926402|date=26 June 2020|archiveurl=https://archive.is/4FoKi|archivedate=16 July 2020}}.\n\n==Multiple logging-in==\nAccording to [[Jagex]] per the [https://www.runescape.com/game-info Game Guide]{{CiteSupport|url=https://www.runescape.com/game-guide/rules|title=Rules of RuneScape|sectitle=Multiple logging-in|quote=You are free to create as many accounts as you like and you are welcome to trade between your accounts just as you would with any other legitimate player.|postdate= 7 March 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/zrLYJ|archivedate=2 February 2019}}:\n\n{{Cquote2|You are free to create as many [[account]]s as you like and you are welcome to trade between your accounts just as you would with any other legitimate player.\n\nHowever, if any of your accounts obtained wealth by rule breaking activity for example [[macro]] use (botting) or [[real world trading]] (buying gold or items from 3rd parties) then all your accounts will be [[banned]].\n\nSimilarly, multi-logged accounts must not interact with each other to exploit gameplay mechanics, such as attempting to rig the result of a minigame.\n\nTrading wealth or items between your own accounts is done entirely at your own risk. Unconventional trade methods like [[Drop trick|drop]]-, [[death]]- or [[Scams#Trust trading scams|trust-trades]] are particularly risky and we strongly advise against them.\n\nYou may log into multiple accounts across all versions of RuneScape at the same time, however any account you are using must not be involved in any rule breaking or exploitative activity. Any penalties or sanction for such behaviour will be applied to all of your accounts.}}\n\n==Consequences for abuse==\n[[Jagex]] may take action against players who violate the Code of Conduct in the game or in the [[RuneScape Forums]]. Offences, their evidence and subsequent punishments can be viewed and appealed by players using the {{RSL|Account Status}} system.\n\n===Mute===\n{{Main|Mute}}\nA [[mute]] is a form of punishment given by in-game [[Player Moderator]]s or [[Jagex Moderator]]s (the [[Customer Support]] team) to players who are guilty of breaching the Code of Conduct. Mutes given out by Player Moderators last up to 48 hours, long enough for Jagex's Customer Support team to investigate the situation. A muted player will not be able to talk in-game or on the [[RuneScape Forums]]; however, they can still play the game as usual and [[trade]] with other players.\n\n===Ban===\n{{Main|Ban}}\nGame [[bans]] restrict players' access to their accounts, usually for repeated or severe violations of the Code of Conduct. If the player appeals their ban, it may be accepted, either restoring the account completely or with a permanent [[mute]].\n\nBans from the [[RuneScape Forums]] are given by [[Forum Moderator]]s and [[Jagex Moderator]]s for essentially similar reasons to those in-game; however, they also include flaming, spamming and other forum-specific rules. If a player is muted or banned from the game, they are also automatically banned from the Forums.\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 27 November 2014\n|poll = Old School Game Integrity Survey\n|update = Integrity Survey Followup\n|change = \n*Commission staking is now against the rules.

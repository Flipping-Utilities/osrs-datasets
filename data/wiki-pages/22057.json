However, many gods, the most significant being Saradomin and Zamorak, wanted complete control.\n\nSoon after Zaros's defeat, a massive war broke out.

This is some of the last remaining armour that was used during the God Wars.\n\n==Combatants==\nEvery race, god, and civilisation of RuneScape was forced to fight in the God Wars at some point.

She is narrowly stopped by the Saradominist [[Temple Knights]], an organisation which was founded during the God Wars as well.\n*[[Hazeel]] conquers the land that is now [[Ardougne]].\n*Padewwa, Kharyrll, Lassar, Dareeyak, Carrallangar, Anakarl, and Ghorrock, Zaros's last remaining fortresses, are destroyed.\n*The [[Tears of Guthix (minigame)|Tears of Guthix]] cause much of the rock beneath present-day [[Lumbridge]] to weep with godly energy.\n*A large cavern in an icy land north of [[Trollheim]] plays host to a massive battle between the followers of Bandos, Saradomin, Zamorak, and Armadyl. The cave is hidden during the battle, freezing the combatants. Thousands of years later, in the year 169 of the Fifth Age, the combatants are unfrozen due to tectonic movement in the Wilderness. They then resume their battle.\n*The [[wyrms]], a species of ancient dragons much more powerful than any known dragon today, slowly disappear from continued use in combat and evolution.\n*The [[wyverns]], a species of flightless two-legged dragons, become extinct due to a massive climate shift.\n*[[Orikalkum]], a type of rare metal forged into [[dragon equipment|armour and weapons]] by the [[dragonkin]], falls into the hands of several other races such as humans and [[Fairy|Fairies]].\n*The knowledge of [[Ancient Magicks]], which were used only by followers of Zaros, is forgotten by most of RuneScape, leaving very few with the knowledge of how to use them.\n\n~Note: Some historians speculate that the Seven Priestly Warriors actually fought early in the Fourth Age, before the founding of Varrock. This is further supported by the fact that the warriors are said to have come from modern day areas such as Taverley and Lumbridge. However, others suggest that these lands were occupied by other villages at the time. Because of this large uncertainty, this event is generally accepted to be part of the God Wars.\n\n===Major battles===\nDuring the God Wars there were thousands of battles and wars between the people of RuneScape. Although many battles and wars of the Third Age have been forgotten, some of the more significant battles are still remembered today, such as the ones listed below. Please note that although these battles are more or less in order, there may be some that are slightly out of place.\n\n*[[Betrayal of Zaros]]\n*[[The Fall of Senntisten]]\n*[[The Wilderness Campaign]] (Wilderness Ruins)\n*[[The Dorgeshuun Civil War]]\n*[[The Sea Slug Conflicts]]\n*[[The Fall of Hallowvalle]]\n*[[The Morytania Campaign]]\n*[[Uzer|The Destruction of Uzer]]\n*[[The Battle of Ardougne]]\n*[[The Mortals Retreat]]\n\n{{History}}"}

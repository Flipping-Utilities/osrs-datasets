Accounts can be stolen if an attacker obtains the login name and the associated password. If a computer is infected with a key-logger, it is possible for a thief to learn the login name and password combinations. Even without such malware infections, weak passwords might be guessed.\n</p><p>If an account thief is armed with only a username and the password, they will not be able to access the items stored away in the account's bank. Additionally, a keylogger cannot easily obtain the PIN, because players have to click on the numbers instead of typing them.\n</p><p>Bank PINs are the best things players can have to protect their bank account and it is strongly recommended to have one. In addition, players are well advised to only access their account from a trusted and non-infected computer. A non-obvious password and periodic password changes also help to prevent unauthorized access to accounts.\n</p><p>The Bank PIN system also appears when attempting to enter the <a href=\"/w/Player-owned_house\" title=\"Player-owned house\">player-owned house</a> in <a href=\"/w/Building_mode\" title=\"Building mode\">building mode</a> for the first time after logging into the game.

Programs that take a screen shot every time the user clicks the mouse will obtain a screen where only the PIN key is made blank.

It was introduced in [[Update:Security feature - Bank PIN|the Bank PIN update]] on [[19 September]] [[2005]].\n\nTrying to find out someone's bank PIN goes against Rule 3 - Password Scamming (see [[Rules of RuneScape]]). It is also good to note that an unsuccessful attempt in gaining one's bank PIN is also against the rules and that one can get reported for doing such act.\n\n{{cquote2|Asking for someone's bank PIN is just as serious as asking for an account password...

Once they have done this, they may then set a 4-digit PIN. The Bank PIN may be cancelled before it is put to use.\n\nTheir bank will then have a bank PIN in 7 days.\n\nUnlike the [[RuneScape Authenticator|Authenticator]], the PIN is game-specific. Setting a PIN in ''Old School RuneScape'' will not automatically set it in ''[[rsw:RuneScape|RuneScape]]'' and vice versa.\n\n===Removing a bank PIN===\nTo remove a bank PIN, simply talk to the Banker, click \"I'd like to check my PIN settings\", and then press \"Delete PIN\". Based on player's discretion, the PIN will be removed in either 3 or 7 days.\n\n==Using a bank PIN==\n[[File:Bank PIN interface.png|right|thumb|Entering a PIN]]\nWhen a player has a bank PIN, they must then click on the 4 numbers they set it to. Once they have done this, they will have access to their bank account. The bank stays unlocked until the player logs out or loses their connection. The numbers on the keypad shift around after being clicked on, and the numbers move around within their red boxes. This is to prevent spyware that tracks mouse movements from compromising the PIN.\n\nAfter two failed attempts to enter the bank PIN, the system locks the player out for 10 seconds and tells them to use the \"cancel\" option if they have made a mistake in entering their PIN. After another failed attempt the system locks the player out for 15 seconds. Once four fail attempts are made, the player must wait 10 minutes before trying again.\n\nAs of [[9 March]] [[2017]], players can now choose whether bank PINs should stay unlocked for 5 minutes after logging out by speaking to a [[banker]] and opening the PIN settings menu. This would allow players to [[hop worlds]] or take a quick bathroom break without having to re-enter the bank PIN when logging back in. However, if players appear to be logging in from a different IP address or computer, the bank PIN will always re-lock itself immediately.\n\n===Advantages===\nBesides having an extra 20 bank spaces available when active, bank PINs serve as a form of damage control against account thieves. Accounts can be stolen if an attacker obtains the login name and the associated password. If a computer is infected with a key-logger, it is possible for a thief to learn the login name and password combinations. Even without such malware infections, weak passwords might be guessed.\n\nIf an account thief is armed with only a username and the password, they will not be able to access the items stored away in the account's bank. Additionally, a keylogger cannot easily obtain the PIN, because players have to click on the numbers instead of typing them.\n\nBank PINs are the best things players can have to protect their bank account and it is strongly recommended to have one. In addition, players are well advised to only access their account from a trusted and non-infected computer. A non-obvious password and periodic password changes also help to prevent unauthorized access to accounts.\n\nThe Bank PIN system also appears when attempting to enter the [[player-owned house]] in [[building mode]] for the first time after logging into the game. This helps protect the player-owned house from vandalism and/or theft from the [[Costume Room]].\n\n===Weaknesses===\nBank PINs cannot protect against more advanced hacking software. Programs that take a screen shot every time the user clicks the mouse will obtain a screen where only the PIN key is made blank. The surrounding keys still show their number, so the PIN key can be deduced from the captured screen. Hence, bank PINs cannot always prevent hacking, although they provide a decent additional layer of security.\n\n==Choosing a PIN==\nSome of these things are told in the [[Stronghold of Security]], while others are just helpful to know. Here are some PINs that players should '''avoid''' using:\n\n*Their own birthday - many players use this, but it is not advised, as those who know the player may know their birthday.\n*A real life PIN - Jagex cannot absolutely guarantee the security of their database, and if it were compromised then players could be at risk of losing real-life money.\n*The last 4 digits of a national identification number (such as [[wikipedia:Social Security Number|SSN]] or [[wikipedia:National Insurance number|NINO]]) - If anyone finds the PIN to be a SSN, the player may be in trouble in real life\n*The last four digits of a telephone number - someone might know this information.\n*Pins such as 4,4,4,4 (4 same digits), 3,4,5,6 (4 digits in sequence) and 8,7,6,5 (in reverse sequence) cannot be used.\n\n===Good PIN choices===\n*A random number - be sure to memorise this well\n*Spell a word using the telephone keys\n*Player may also use a calculator (e.g. the calculator in Windows) to add random numbers together\n\n==Situations requiring a PIN==\n*Accessing the bank\n*Accessing the [[Seed Vault]]\n*Trading at the [[Grand Exchange]]\n*Entering [[Building mode]] in a [[Player-owned house]]\n*Opening/searching stored items in a Player-owned house [[Costume Room]] or [[Menagerie]]\n*Accessing the [[Party Room]] chest\n*Accessing a player's Miscellania funds\n*Accessing the [[Slayer reward point|reward points interface]]\n*Accessing a [[STASH unit]]\n*Using the [[Nightmare Zone]] coffer\n*Redeeming an [[Old school bond]]\n*Accessing a [[Tool Leprechaun]]<ref>[[Update:Hosidius Rework and Deadman Beta]]</ref>\n*Using the [[Blast Furnace]] coffer \n*Adding ore to the [[Blast Furnace]] conveyor belt\n*Changing your [[Display name|Display Name]]\n*Fishing from the [[Reward pool]]\n*Opening the [[Loot Chest]] with a [[loot key]]\n\n==Further reading and advice on account security==\nPlayers who wish to be extra cautious can choose to deposit their items in the bank when they are done playing for the day, however, keeping your account secure with [[RuneScape Authenticator|''RuneScape'' Authenticator]] is crucial in protecting your account from hijackers. Having 2 step authentication on your email as well adds even more security.\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 16 April 2015\n|update = Clan Wars Game Modes & More\n|change = Logging out no longer resets bank pin lockout counters.\n}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 30 October 2014\n|update = Target Teleport & Fedora Tip\n|change = Bankpin sounds have been reverted to their original audio.\n}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 13 October 2014\n|update = Ironman Mode\n|change = [[Mod Ash]] has re-vamped the bank PIN system to make it much more responsive.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Interface]]\n[[Category:Mechanics]]\n[[Category:Security]]"}

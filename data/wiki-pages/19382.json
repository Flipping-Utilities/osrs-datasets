In one of their polls, they asked players if they would want a new Halloween event but also delay the release of <i>RuneScape 2</i> Beta, or keep it on schedule and have a \"pancake day\" in February instead. 78% of voters wanted a <a href=\"https://runescape.wiki/w/2003_Halloween_event\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"rsw:2003 Halloween event\">2003 Halloween event</a>. However, <i>RuneScape 2</i> was still released on schedule, because the developers came in early and on weekends to do extra work.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The new <a href=\"/w/Combat\" title=\"Combat\">combat</a> system was explained in detail in a 24 November newspost.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Beta\">Beta</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/RuneScape_2?section=2&amp;veaction=edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: Beta\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/w/RuneScape_2?action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Beta\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/w/File:RuneScape_2_beta_login_page.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/RuneScape_2_beta_login_page.png/300px-RuneScape_2_beta_login_page.png?5f850\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"202\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/RuneScape_2_beta_login_page.png/450px-RuneScape_2_beta_login_page.png?5f850 1.5x, /images/thumb/RuneScape_2_beta_login_page.png/600px-RuneScape_2_beta_login_page.png?5f850 2x\" data-file-width=\"789\" data-file-height=\"532\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/w/File:RuneScape_2_beta_login_page.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>RuneScape 2 Beta Login</div></div></div>\n<p>All <a href=\"/w/Members\" title=\"Members\">members</a> had access to the first phase of RS2 Beta.

Some of the changes and additions include:\n</p>\n<ul><li>A new core engine, allowing <a href=\"/w/Jagex\" title=\"Jagex\">Jagex</a> to expand the game to levels not previously possible (paving the way for new content such as complex <a href=\"/w/Player-versus-player\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Player-versus-player\">player-versus-player</a> <a href=\"/w/Minigames\" title=\"Minigames\">minigames</a>, <a href=\"/w/Player-owned_house\" title=\"Player-owned house\">player-owned houses</a>, and randomly-generated scenarios, which would be added over the coming years).</li>\n<li>Upgraded 3D graphics, along with animations. Every character in the game had to be redesigned, and the use of polygons allowed a greater level of detail for landscapes (for example, walls and fences could have thickness). Animations used more frames, allowing for smoother motion and a wider variety of animations. The camera was also updated to move vertically as well as horizontally.</li>\n<li>Complete rework of the <a href=\"/w/Combat\" title=\"Combat\">Combat</a> system. The <a href=\"/w/Combat_Triangle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Combat Triangle\">Combat Triangle</a> concept was central to the new system. The traditional \"three round\" model was removed. This made it possible to move around, eat <a href=\"/w/Food\" title=\"Food\">food</a>, use <a href=\"/w/Ranged\" title=\"Ranged\">Ranged</a> <a href=\"/w/Weapons\" title=\"Weapons\">weapons</a>, and perform most other actions while in combat. The <a href=\"/w/Bind\" title=\"Bind\">Bind</a>, <a href=\"/w/Snare\" title=\"Snare\">Snare</a>, and <a href=\"/w/Entangle\" title=\"Entangle\">Entangle</a> <a href=\"/w/Spells\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Spells\">spells</a> were introduced for <a href=\"/w/Mage\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mage\">mages</a> to use in <a href=\"/w/PVP\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"PVP\">PVP</a>. Mages were also given the ability to <a href=\"/w/Autocast\" title=\"Autocast\">autocast</a> most combat spells using a <a href=\"/w/Staff\" title=\"Staff\">staff</a>. <a href=\"/w/Attack_style\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Attack style\">Attack styles</a> were added to <a href=\"/w/Melee\" title=\"Melee\">Melee</a> weapons, encouraging fighters to try a variety of weapons against different opponents (contrasting RS1, where the dominant strategy was to always use either a <a href=\"/w/Battleaxe\" title=\"Battleaxe\">battleaxe</a> or a <a href=\"/w/Two-handed_sword\" title=\"Two-handed sword\">two-handed sword</a>). The former 'Paralyze Monster' and 'Protect from Missiles' <a href=\"/w/Prayer\" title=\"Prayer\">prayers</a> were replaced with the familiar <a href=\"/w/Protect_from_Melee\" title=\"Protect from Melee\">Protect from Melee</a>, <a href=\"/w/Protect_from_Magic\" title=\"Protect from Magic\">Protect from Magic</a>, and modern <a href=\"/w/Protect_from_Missiles\" title=\"Protect from Missiles\">Protect from Missiles</a> prayers. Several locations were designated as <a href=\"/w/Multicombat_area\" title=\"Multicombat area\">multicombat areas</a>. <a href=\"/w/Monster\" title=\"Monster\">Monsters</a> became more intelligent, with some using Ranged, Magic, and other special attacks. Finally, the equations for calculating <a href=\"/w/Combat_level\" title=\"Combat level\">combat level</a> and gaining experience were reformulated.</li>\n<li>New <a href=\"/w/Interface\" title=\"Interface\">interfaces</a>. Several tabs that were merged together in RS1 (i.e. <a href=\"/w/Friends_List\" title=\"Friends List\">Friends List</a>/<a href=\"/w/Ignore_List\" title=\"Ignore List\">Ignore List</a>, options/logout, Magic/Prayer) were separated in RS2. Notably, it became much easier to use shops and <a href=\"/w/Bank\" title=\"Bank\">banks</a> or to trade with other players because players could add or remove large quantities of items with a single click. Dialogue boxes were also introduced for conversations with <a href=\"/w/NPC\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"NPC\">NPCs</a>, allowing more than one player to talk to a given character at a time.</li>\n<li>Upgraded audio system. RS1 only had a small selection of sound effects, and they were only available to members. RS2 added more sound effects, as well as <a href=\"/w/Music\" title=\"Music\">music</a>, for all players. The new <a href=\"/w/Music_Player\" title=\"Music Player\">Music Player</a> allowed players to unlock and replay songs as they found them.</li>\n<li>Bank <a href=\"/w/Note\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Note\">notes</a>, making it much easier to buy and sell items to other players. This was originally planned as bank-to-bank <a href=\"/w/Trading\" title=\"Trading\">trading</a>, but was changed because Jagex didn't want banks to become too crowded.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>The ability to <a href=\"/w/Run\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Run\">run</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/w/Runecraft\" title=\"Runecraft\">Runecraft</a> skill and <a href=\"/w/Rune_Mysteries\" title=\"Rune Mysteries\">Rune Mysteries</a> quest.</li>\n<li>New system for duelling.

The working name was ''RuneScape 3D''., to distinguish it from what is now known as ''[[RuneScape Classic]]'', which used 2D graphics for several entities. The finished version was launched on [[29 March]] [[2004]] ({{UD|RS2 Launched!}}). It is one of the largest [[updates]] since the game's initial launch. It saw the introduction of a more powerful game engine, three-dimensional graphics, a new [[combat]] system, improved sound including the addition of [[music]], and many other new features.\n\nCompared with its predecessor, this three-dimensional version featured a vast improvement to the game engine as well as improving on the sound and interfaces. The core engine allowed Jagex to expand the game to levels previously not possible.\n\n==History==\n[[Jagex]] first announced the upcoming release of a \"much faster 3D engine\" in {{UD|Update_on_RuneScape_development_progress|an update}} on [[11 June]] [[2002]]. Over time, Jagex released graphical previews as well as progress reports and other information about the many future changes.\n\nThe project was first referred to as \"RuneScape 2\" in an October 2003 news post (it was previously known as the \"big 3D update\" or the \"new game engine\").{{CiteNews|author = Jagex|url = http://services.runescape.com/m=news/g=runescape/rs2-beta---date-decided|title = RS2 beta - date decided!|newsdate = [[1 October]] [[2003]]|accessdate = 20:05, May 7, 2017 (UTC)}} It was also revealed that the beta would become available on 1 December.\n\nJagex originally did not want to create a [[Halloween]] event for 2003, because they feared it would delay the planned release date of the beta. In one of their polls, they asked players if they would want a new Halloween event but also delay the release of ''RuneScape 2'' Beta, or keep it on schedule and have a \"pancake day\" in February instead. 78% of voters wanted a {{RSL|2003 Halloween event}}. However, ''RuneScape 2'' was still released on schedule, because the developers came in early and on weekends to do extra work.{{CiteNews|author = Jagex|url = http://services.runescape.com/m=news/newsitem.ws?id=135|title = RS2 is still on schedule|newsdate = [[2 November]] [[2003]]|accessdate = 20:05, May 7, 2017 (UTC)}}\n\nThe new [[combat]] system was explained in detail in a 24 November newspost.{{CiteNews|author = Jagex|url = http://services.runescape.com/m=news/rs2-combat-system-explained?jptg=ia&jptv=news_archive|title = RS2 Combat system explained|newsdate = [[24 November]] [[2003]]|accessdate = 20:05, May 7, 2017 (UTC)}}\n\n===Beta===\n[[File:RuneScape_2_beta_login_page.png|thumb|RuneScape 2 Beta Login]]\nAll [[members]] had access to the first phase of RS2 Beta. Their [[character]]s and [[skills]] were copied over from the stable build of ''RuneScape'', but their items and [[quest]] history were not. This was deliberate, as [[Jagex]] wanted players to test all of their content. Initially, only the [[free-to-play]] area was available with new areas and quests released gradually over the beta period. The [[Lumbridge Teleport]] spell was also deliberately broken so that it could be cast without [[runes]] even at level 1 [[Magic]]. This allowed players to escape to a safe area in the event they found themselves trapped by a [[glitch]].\n\nThe second phase of Beta began on [[3 March]] [[2004]]. Players again had their characters copied over from the stable build of ''RuneScape'' (including items and quest status this time). The Lumbridge Teleport spell also had its level requirement and rune cost reinstated.\n\nOn 17 March, the final phase began. Characters were once again copied over from the stable build of ''RuneScape''. For this stage of testing, free players were given access to Beta as well as members.\n\n===Release===\n''RuneScape 2'' was launched on [[29 March]] [[2004]].{{CiteNews|author = Jagex|url = http://services.runescape.com/m=news/rs2-launched?jptg=ia&jptv=news_archive|title = RS2 Launched!|newsdate = [[29 March]] [[2004]]|accessdate = 20:05, May 7, 2017 (UTC)}} Players' [[stats]] and [[quest]] history were copied over to RS2, which became known only as ''RuneScape'' to reflect its status as the main game, one last time. Several ''RuneScape 1'' servers were also left online, and it was officially named \"[[RuneScape Classic]]\". Players were given the choice as to which game they wanted their items to be transferred to. Afterward, they became completely independent of each other (aside from sharing login information and the [[friends list]]).\n\nThe final piece of content, the [[Underground Pass]] quest, was added to RS2 on 15 April.{{CiteNews|author = Jagex|url = http://services.runescape.com/m=news/the-underground-pass-1?jptg=ia&jptv=news_archive|title = The Underground Pass|newsdate = [[15 April]] [[2004]]|accessdate = 20:05, May 7, 2017 (UTC)}}\n\n==Features==\n''RuneScape 2'' dramatically impacted the gameplay [[experience]]. Some of the changes and additions include:\n\n*A new core engine, allowing [[Jagex]] to expand the game to levels not previously possible (paving the way for new content such as complex [[player-versus-player]] [[minigames]], [[player-owned house]]s, and randomly-generated scenarios, which would be added over the coming years).\n*Upgraded 3D graphics, along with animations. Every character in the game had to be redesigned, and the use of polygons allowed a greater level of detail for landscapes (for example, walls and fences could have thickness). Animations used more frames, allowing for smoother motion and a wider variety of animations. The camera was also updated to move vertically as well as horizontally.\n*Complete rework of the [[Combat]] system. The [[Combat Triangle]] concept was central to the new system. The traditional \"three round\" model was removed. This made it possible to move around, eat [[food]], use [[Ranged]] [[weapons]], and perform most other actions while in combat. The [[Bind]], [[Snare]], and [[Entangle]] [[spells]] were introduced for [[mage]]s to use in [[PVP]]. Mages were also given the ability to [[autocast]] most combat spells using a [[staff]]. [[Attack style]]s were added to [[Melee]] weapons, encouraging fighters to try a variety of weapons against different opponents (contrasting RS1, where the dominant strategy was to always use either a [[battleaxe]] or a [[two-handed sword]]). The former 'Paralyz<!--spelled this way ingame! !-->e Monster' and 'Protect from Missiles' [[prayer]]s were replaced with the familiar [[Protect from Melee]], [[Protect from Magic]], and modern [[Protect from Missiles]] prayers. Several locations were designated as [[multicombat area]]s. [[Monster]]s became more intelligent, with some using Ranged, Magic, and other special attacks. Finally, the equations for calculating [[combat level]] and gaining experience were reformulated.\n*New [[interface]]s. Several tabs that were merged together in RS1 (i.e. [[Friends List]]/[[Ignore List]], options/logout, Magic/Prayer) were separated in RS2. Notably, it became much easier to use shops and [[bank]]s or to trade with other players because players could add or remove large quantities of items with a single click. Dialogue boxes were also introduced for conversations with [[NPC]]s, allowing more than one player to talk to a given character at a time.\n*Upgraded audio system. RS1 only had a small selection of sound effects, and they were only available to members. RS2 added more sound effects, as well as [[music]], for all players. The new [[Music Player]] allowed players to unlock and replay songs as they found them.\n*Bank [[note]]s, making it much easier to buy and sell items to other players. This was originally planned as bank-to-bank [[trading]], but was changed because Jagex didn't want banks to become too crowded.{{CiteNews|author = Jagex|url = http://services.runescape.com/m=news/g=runescape/bank-notes|title = Bank Notes!|newsdate = [[10 February]] [[2004]]|accessdate = 20:05, May 7, 2017 (UTC)}}\n*The ability to [[run]].\n*[[Runecraft]] skill and [[Rune Mysteries]] quest.\n*New system for duelling. The [[Duel Arena]] was added to the game, and duelling elsewhere became impossible. The new system had more options for defining the parameters of a battle.\n*Expanded [[Crafting#Leather|leather crafting]], producing new [[armour]] for rangers (including [[hard leather body]], [[studded leather armour]], and [[dragonhide armour]]).\n*Removal of {{RSL|RuneScape Classic#Fatigue|fatigue}} and addition of [[random events]].\n*New weapons, including [[warhammers]] and [[throwing axes]].\n*Special animations for [[emotes]].\n*More options for customising a player's basic [[Makeover|appearance]], with the introduction of the [[Hairdresser's Salon]] and [[Thessalia's Makeovers]].\n*Addition of the [[Ranging Guild]].\n*Enhanced [[Party Hall]], for holding drop parties.\n*Two new type of bones: [[Babydragon bones]] dropped by [[baby dragon]]s, and [[burnt bones]] found in the [[Wilderness]].\n*[[Lantadyme]] [[herb]] and [[Antifire potion]], to combat [[dragons]]' new [[dragonfire]] attack.\n*[[Mithril seeds]] began producing [[flowers]], which could be picked and wielded.\n*[[Free players]] were given access to [[trees]] and [[logs]] up to [[yew logs|yew]] along with [[bows]] up to [[maple]] (with corresponding [[arrows]] up to [[adamant arrow|adamant]]). It became possible to burn logs above and including [[oak logs|oak]], and it was no longer necessary to drop logs before lighting them.\n*NPCs began [[Stun (status)|stunning]] players instead of attacking them upon unsuccessful [[pickpocketing]].\n*[[Newcomer map]]s, to help new players find their way around the world.\n*The ability to [[decant]] [[potions]], combining low-dosed [[vials]] into higher-dosed ones.\n\n==See also==\n*[[RuneScape]]\n*[[RuneScape Classic]]\n*[[RuneScape- The Official Handbook|RuneScape: The Official Handbook]]\n*{{RSL|RuneScape High Detail|RuneScape High Detail}}\n*{{RSL|RuneScape 3|RuneScape 3}}\n*{{RSL|RuneTek|RuneTek}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Jagex]]\n[[Category:Game info]]\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:''RuneScape 2''}}\n{{Restricted title|Subject name is italicised}}"}

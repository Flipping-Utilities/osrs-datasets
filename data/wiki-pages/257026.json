While considered a [[glitch]] by many, lag is not exactly the same. It typically has to do with the [[server]] space and a player's own computer. The amount of lag depends on several factors, such as server load, internet connection, and computer specifications.\n\n[[File:Connection lost.png|thumb|A player loses connection after receiving a valuable drop.]]\nLag always exists, from undetectable to complete connection loss which is unreliable. Lag is not fixable by [[Jagex]]. Lag is a very common cause of [[death]], so one should not partake in dangerous activities while suffering from lag, such as playing [[Barrows]], [[player killing]], [[boss hunting]] or fighting any [[powerful monsters]], especially for [[hardcore ironmen]].\n\n==Types of lag==\n===Frame rate===\nComputer lag is one type of lag, often caused by insufficient RAM (Random Access Memory), CPU (Central Processing Unit) power or GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) power. This type of lag exists when the game redraws at a very slow rate, causing the screen to take time loading. Computer lag is more common when a lot of people are standing in an area, forcing the computer to spend more time redrawing.\n\nWindows users may determine what aspect of their hardware is causing the problem (be it CPU, RAM or GPU) by opening the task manager on Windows and switching to the Performance tab. If they are running a single-core CPU, or if their CPU usage is frequently approaching 100%, their CPU may be at fault; if their Physical Memory usage is often above 80%, they should consider upgrading their RAM (the operating system uses this memory sparingly if it is insufficient, and therefore, it is rare that more than 90% will be used at a time); if neither of these hardware aspects appear to be problematic, it is likely that their graphics card is at fault.\n\nIf using macOS, quitting unnecessary applications and checking Activity Monitor for processes using large amounts of memory and CPU load could mitigate the problem. Furthermore, some of the most pertinent issues surrounding ''[[RuneScape]]'' on Mac would pertain to use of Safari, especially more recent versions with multiple browser windows open. Mac users would greatly benefit from switching to Firefox or Chrome, or even just playing with the [[Game Client]].\n\n===Internet lag===\nInternet lag is another very common type of lag. It is caused by the user's internet connection, their Internet Service Provider or bandwidth limitations in the connection to the ''[[RuneScape]]'' [[server]] in question. Information is sent from ''RuneScape'' to their computer in packages; if these packages become \"lost\" or corrupted on the way, it may take the ''RuneScape'' server a while to realise this and then attempt to correct the error. This form of lag is usually neither their fault nor Jagex's fault and is typically unavoidable.\n\nIf an exception is thrown when attempting client-server communication, the \"Connection lost. Please wait - attempting to reestablish...\" message appears in the top-left corner. Then, the client attempts to reconnect to the server, which may fail. This may happen if the connection suddenly ends, such as by unplugging the Ethernet cable.\n\nOtherwise, no network error is detected and the client continues to attempt communication with the server until time-out. Everything on the screen will freeze, while it is still possible to manipulate already-existing data such as rotating the camera, scrolling through the chat box, or right-clicking items or objects. If connection is not achieved by a certain time limit (five to twenty seconds), the game will automatically log out.\n\nIn extreme cases, if the amount of data allowed between client and server is very limited, data from the server to client is sent first. This includes movement of [[NPCs]] and other players, damage, etc. In this case, the player experiencing lag will be unable to move, talk, eat, or provide any input to the server. If the player is in combat at this time, they will not be able to retaliate, even if [[Auto Retaliate]] is on. The time-out is irrelevant in this instance, and the player will automatically log out in five minutes (more if in [[combat]]).\n\nIf the player has just [[died]] and has lost items outside of [[Item Retrieval Services]], they have roughly 15 minutes from the moment they died in order to retrieve their items from their [[grave]] before they are moved to the [[Death's Office]]. The game treats it as if there is no lag and receives no commands from the player. This also applies when a server update is due. The countdown will continue regardless of lag.\n\n===Server lag===\nLag at the [[server]] is common. This happens when the server itself cannot handle the simultaneous requests of all its clients and processes. This is the only lag that is caused by [[Jagex]]. It cannot be easily reproduced, and attempting to create this type of lag is [[reportable]] under [[bug abuse]].\n\n==What to do when lagging==\n* Download and use the official ''Old School RuneScape'' [[Game Client]].\n* Close any memory- or CPU-intensive programs you have running.\n* Pause or stop any downloads you have in progress.\n* Try switching to a [[world]] with a lower [[Ping (Server)|ping]] value and/or less people.\n* Restart your computer. Often, if a computer is left on for an extended period of time (e.g. more than a week), it could be significantly slower.\n* Update your graphics drivers. Newer graphics drivers can sometimes increase performance due to bugs/glitches being fixed.\n\n{{mechanics}}"}

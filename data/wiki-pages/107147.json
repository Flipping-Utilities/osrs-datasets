It was released on the 7th of December 2017 as part of a teaser update for [[Dragon Slayer II]].\n{{ToC}}\n{{clear}}\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Speak to [[Captain Tock]] at the crossroads north of [[Port Sarim]].\n|difficulty = 2\n|description = From the newly revealed town of Corsair Cove, deep in the south of Feldip Hills, the captain of the Corsairs has sailed to Port Sarim seeking help. His crew is sick, and he suspects that a curse has been laid upon them.\n\nIf you can unravel the fearful and conflicting tales of ogre relics, vengeful mermaids and demonic possession, maybe you can help his ailing crew overcome The Corsair Curse.\n|length = Short\n|requirements =\n|items =\n* [[Spade]] (obtainable during quest)\n* [[Tinderbox]] (obtainable during quest)\n|recommended = \n* {{SCP|Combat|20|link=yes}}\n* [[Energy potion]]s or ''([[members]] only)'' [[stamina potion]]s\n* [[Weapon]], [[armour]] and some [[food]]\n|kills = [[Ithoi the Navigator]] (level 35)\n}}\n\n===The cursed crew===\n[[File:Captain Tock chathead.png|left]]\nSpeak to [[Captain Tock]] at the crossroads just north of [[Port Sarim]]. He will tell you that his crew of Corsairs has been inflicted with a curse and asks for your help. After you agree to help him, a brief cut scene will show you where you can find the boat (the dock at the western end of [[Rimmington]]). Speak to Captain Tock again on the dock to sail to [[Corsair Cove]].\n\nThere are four crew members to speak to: [[Ithoi the Navigator]], [[Arsen the Thief]], [[Cabin Boy Colin]] and [[Gnocci the Cook]]. Refer to the map for their exact locations (note: they are each upstairs in their huts, you need to climb the stairs for each of them).\n\n{{Map|mtype=pin|align=right|caption=A map of all the important locations visited during the quest.\n|2523,2861,title:[[Chief Tess]],desc:\n|2579,2840,title:[[Captain Tock]],desc:\n|2531,2833,title:[[Ithoi the Navigator]],desc:\n|2545,2862,title:[[Gnocci the Cook]],desc:\n|2556,2856,title:[[Arsen the Thief]] and [[Cabin Boy Colin]],desc:\n|2503,2839,title:Possessed doll,desc:\n}}\nIf you haven't obtained a [[spade]] and [[tinderbox]] already, a tinderbox can be found beside Gnocci the Cook and a spade can be found planted in the sand under the big Tropical Tree south-east of Gnocci the Cook's hut, near the rocks (does not appear as a red dot in mini map). Note: The bank (run by [[Yusuf]]) will not be accessible until this quest is completed.\n\n'''Visit Ithoi first in his hut''' (as the other three crew members will simply instruct you to talk to Ithoi), located upstairs in the large hut south-west of Corsair Cove. He will claim it is a curse and that there are many things that can cause them.\n\nArsen and Colin are upstairs in the large hut immediately west of the dock and Gnocci is upstairs in the smaller hut slightly further to the west.\n\nAfter talking to Ithoi, investigate what may have caused the curse by speaking to Arsen, Colin, and Gnocci in any order; each will tell you they caused the curse with various events that occurred to each respectively. Each crew member's claim will need to be investigated further.\n\n===Arsen's \"curse\"===\n[[File:Arsen the Thief chathead.png|left]]\n[[Arsen the Thief]] was asked by Captain Tock to explore some caves west of the cove. He was immediately spotted by the ogres as he climbed down, and in a panic, grabbed some loot and quickly escaped. He believes he may have stolen a sacred relic and the shamans have cursed his crew for stealing it.\n\nSpeak to Captain Tock located on the ship and ask him for the relic. As he has no use for it, he gives you the [[Ogre artefact (The Corsair Curse)|ogre artefact]].\n\nHead west of the cove and down the hole into the [[Corsair Cove Dungeon]]. Speak to [[Chief Tess]] at the entrance. She will tell you that he simply grabbed one of her many tooth-picks and that her shamans have not cursed the crew.\n\nReturn to Arsen to explain what actually happened. Arsen is assured that the curse was not his fault.\n\n===Colin's \"curse\"===\n[[File:The Corsair Curse - Colin sees a mermaid.png|thumb|right|Colin sees a mermaid through Ithoi's telescope.]]\n[[File:Cabin Boy Colin chathead.png|left]]\n[[Cabin Boy Colin]] believes he may have offended a mermaid after he saw one using Ithoi's telescope. He thinks perhaps the mermaid didn't like strangers shouting about her appearance and blowing kisses at her and she cursed the crew as a result.\n\nUse the telescope in Ithoi's hut and discover that the mermaid Colin was referring to is an [[ogre]] called [[Bugs]]. If you have completed [[Big Chompy Bird Hunting]], you will recognise him as [[Rantz]]'s son.\n\nReturn to Colin to explain what actually happened. Colin is assured that the curse was not his fault.\n\n===Gnocci's \"curse\"===\n[[File:The Corsair Curse - possessed doll location.png|thumb|300px|Dig here to find the Demonic Doll]]\n[[File:Gnocci the Cook chathead.png|left]]\n[[Gnocci the Cook]] will tell you that while fishing for food, he discovered \"Her\", a doll possessed by a demon, and buried it next to the tree where he was fishing. He believes that this demon cursed the crew and asks you to kill it.\n\nDig by the lump of sand to the far west of Ithoi's hut (just west of the fishing spot) where he buried the doll during the cutscene. You will discover it is a clockwork [[toy doll]]. If you have at least level 18 [[Crafting]], you will also say that you know how to make a doll just like it.\n\nReturn to Gnocci to explain what actually happened. Gnocci is assured that the curse was not his fault.\n\n===Traitor in the midst===\nAt this point your quest log should end \"I had{{sic}} ruled out all the corsairs' theories about how they had become cursed\"; if not, repeat your conversations with each corsair as needed.\n\nAfter debunking [[Arsen]], [[Colin]], and [[Gnocci]]'s \"curses\", return to Captain Tock on the boat. He will explain to you that the curse began when he and [[Ithoi]] went away for a parlay and returned to find their crew sickly after eating dinner, with Ithoi shortly falling ill as well. As Ithoi was with Captain Tock at the time, he rules out the food as the cause of the curse.\n\nSpeak to Gnocci. You discover that he didn't cook dinner that night, as he was still traumatised from the \"possessed\" doll. He tells you that Ithoi cooked dinner that night instead before leaving for his parlay with Captain Tock. He will also rule out the food as the cause of the curse.\n\nNext, speak to Arsen. He will reveal that his brother, [[Francois]], told him that Ithoi may be dismissed from Tock's crew, as they have settled in the Cove and no longer need a navigator.\n\nNow, speak to Ithoi. Tell him that you heard of him cooking the meal that made the crew sick. He will believe you are accusing him of poisoning his crew and asks why you would think so. Tell him it is because the Captain is thinking of firing him and he will confess to the crime. With the crew believing they were cursed, they would want Ithoi to stay on the crew.\n[[File:The Corsair Curse - Ithoi extinguishes fire.png|thumb|200px|Ithoi runs out to extinguish your fire, proving that he is faking the curse.]]\nSpeak to Ithoi again and tell him you know the curse is fake. He will tell you he will not get up thus being unable to prove he is faking his illness. Leave the hut and use the [[tinderbox]] on the driftwood beneath Ithoi's hut. Ithoi will get up and run outside to douse the flame with magic.\nReturn to [[Captain Tock]], and tell him Ithoi is behind the curse. Outraged, Captain Tock will ask you to kill Ithoi.\n\n===Taking care of Ithoi===\n{{Instance}}\n[[File:Fighting Ithoi the Navigator.png|thumb|right|200px|The player confronts Ithoi.]]\nReturn to Ithoi's hut and he will attack you immediately. He is level 35 and uses elemental [[strike spells]]. He can also use the [[Curse]] spell. Lower levelled players should prepare for this fight, although he does splash quite often. Make sure that if you are using range attacks, that you are comfortable losing the arrows or bolts that you use while fighting Ithoi. They will disappear at the end of the fight.\n\nAfter killing Ithoi, leave his hut and return to Captain Tock. Captain Tock will ask what is happening now. Explain to him that Ithoi was killed for poisoning his crew. He will thank you and allow the crew members to rest and get better. He will also mention that he will speak to [[Yusuf]], located in the bank north of the ship, allowing access to bank on the cove.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = The Corsair Curse\n|image = [[File:The Corsair Curse reward scroll.png|center]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards =\n*Access to [[Yusuf]]'s bank in the [[Corsair Cove]].\n}}\n\n==Transcript==\n{{hastranscript|Quest}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*During the cutscene of Gnocci the Cook fishing for lobsters, he chants, \"Obby-lobby Obby-lobby oi oi oi.\" This is likely a reference to the \"{{wp|Oggy Oggy Oggy|Oggy Oggy Oggy! Oi Oi Oi!}}\" chant that is popular among crowds at sporting events (particularly rugby union) in the UK, Ireland and some Commonwealth nations. It could also be reference to \"Zicke Zacke Zicke Zacke, Hoi, Hoi, Hoi!\", which is the ending to a song called \"Ein Prosit,\" a traditional German toast to health and well-being. This chant is also used frequently on \"The Man Show\" before the hosts toast and drink their beer. \n*Oggy is a pasty in Cornwall U.K. The chant oggy oggy oggy originates there. Cornwall, particularly Penzance, is historically famous for Pirates.\n*When returning to Captain Tock after speaking to the crew and debunking their theories. Captain Tock says, \"Arr, any sufficiently advanced technology be indistinguishable from demonic possession, that it be.\" This is a reference to {{wp|Clarke's three laws}}, the third of which states, \"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\"\n*Captain Tock used to appear as a red dot on the mini map while aboard the ship, instead of a yellow dot. This is a bug and has been fixed.\n*Prior to [[Update:Boss Heads and Chambers of Xeric|an update]], Captain Tock's boat was located in Port Sarim, where [[Veos]]'s boat currently is. This made the Corsair Cove bank one of the closest banks to [[Entrana]] with the lowest requirements. Since the update, it has been replaced by the [[Land's End]] bank.\n*When the quest is completed, Captain Tock is replaced by [[Cabin Boy Colin]], who provides the option to travel between Corsair Cove and Rimmington.\n*The cook’s name, Gnocci, is likely a reference to the food ''{{wp|Gnocchi}}''.\n*If you talk to Madame Caldarium, and respond to her statement \"I guess so.\" Your character will make a reference to ''{{wp|Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones}}'', where Anakin says \"I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.\"\n\n{{The Corsair Curse}}"}

They live predominately in [[Keldagrim]], their capital city, and the city of [[Lovakengj]] on [[Great Kourend]], but are also found in various mines and settlements across Gielinor.\nIn stature, Dwarves tend to be shorter than [[humans]], usually being slightly above human-waist height, but considerably stockier. They are long-lived, although they tend to be gruff and short in temper. They are particularly fond of ale and often have long beards. Dwarves are particularly well known for being excellent blacksmiths, miners, and craftsmen, but usually a dwarf specialises in one area. Dwarves primarily use power-based weapons in combat, such as [[battleaxe]]s, [[warhammer]]s and [[crossbow (weapon)|crossbow]]s.\n\n==History==\nThe dwarves were one of the races brought to [[Gielinor]] by [[Guthix]] the [[God]] of Balance during the [[First Age]]. The dwarves probably lived on the surface, in villages like the humans did.\n\nDuring the [[Second Age]] a group of dwarves known as the [[Imcando dwarf|Imcando dwarves]] dedicated themselves to the god [[Saradomin]].\n\nWhen the [[God Wars]] began most of the dwarves retreated underground to avoid the cataclysmic battles, this led them to adapt to life underground and establishment of the city [[Keldagrim]]. Some of the dwarves eventually fled across the [[Western Sea]], where they established the city of [[Lovakengj]].\n\nThe dwarves of Keldagrim stayed underground for centuries after the God Wars ended, as they were not aware of it. When they resurfaced, they began to establish connection and relations with the [[human]] settlements and kingdoms allowing them to expand their territory, though primarily underground. They also got into conflict with various groups of [[goblin]]s, however during 169 of the [[Fifth Age]], [[Another Slice of H.A.M.|they managed to make a cooperation]] with the more peaceful [[Dorgeshuun]] goblin tribe from [[Dorgesh-Kaan]].  \n\n==Culture==\nDwarven culture consists mostly of feasting, sparring, and songs of great deeds long ago. The dwarven capital of Keldagrim is more advanced, and has many industrial works, banks and trading corporations. Dwarves love gold, and value it greatly; they are portrayed as greedy, which is not untrue - their people are ruled by [[The Consortium|merchants and bureaucrats]]. Nearly all activities in Dwarven territory, particularly Keldagrim, are based around the acquisition of wealth.\n\nThe dwarves are not religious, and although they are Guthixian, they never really worship Guthix in festivals or rituals. There is also a small and secretive cult of dwarves in the [[wilderness]] and in [[Taverley dungeon]] known as the [[chaos dwarves]], who worship [[Zamorak]]. And similarly the [[Imcando dwarf|Imcando dwarves]] worship [[Saradomin]].\n\nDwarven technology is arguably more advanced than that of the [[gnome]]s and [[human]]s, as shown with their minecart systems, [[dwarf multicannon]]s and machinery such as the [[Blast Furnace]].\n\n==Settlements==\nThe dwarves have several settlements around Gielinor:\n*[[Keldagrim]]\n*[[Lovakengj]]\n*[[Dwarven Mine]]\n*[[White Wolf Tunnel]]\n*[[Coal Trucks|Coal truck mine]]\n*[[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground pass]] camp\n\n==Transportation==\nThe dwarves have a few different types of transportation available to humans.\n* The [[Keldagrim minecart system|Keldagrim Minecart System]] -  used to travel to and from the dwarven capital, Keldagrim\n* The [[Dorgesh-Kaan–Keldagrim train system|Dorgesh-Kaan–Keldagrim Train System]] -  an underground railway system created between the cave goblin city of Dorgesh-Kaan and dwarven capital Keldagrim\n* The [[Lovakengj Minecart Network]] - a type of transportation used to travel around the five cities of Great Kourend\n\n==Quests==\nThe dwarves are involved with the following [[quests]]:\n*[[Doric's Quest]]\n*[[The Knight's Sword]]\n*[[Fishing Contest]]\n*[[Dwarf Cannon]]\n*[[The Giant Dwarf]]\n*[[Forgettable Tale...|Forgettable Tale of a Drunken Dwarf]]\n*[[Between a Rock...|Between a Rock]]...\n*[[Recipe for Disaster/Freeing the Mountain Dwarf]]\n*[[Another Slice of H.A.M.|Another Slice of HAM]]\n*[[Ratcatchers]]\n*[[Underground Pass]]\n*[[Grim Tales]]\n*[[The Forsaken Tower]]\n\n==Notable dwarves==\n*[[King Alvis]] - Renowned king of the dwarves.\n*[[The Consortium]] - The eight directors of the largest mining companies in Keldagrim running the city.\n*[[Dinh]] - A legendary dwarven smith, who resided in the [[The_Forsaken_Tower_(location)|Forsaken Tower]], making great pieces of metalwork such as [[Dinh's bulwark]] and the [[Doors of Dinh]].\n*[[Doric]] - Dwarven smith and craftsman residing in a hut north of [[Falador]].\n*[[Drunken Dwarf]] - Inebriated dwarf wandering around handing out free [[beer]] and [[kebab]]s to his 'mateys'.\n*[[Jardric]] - Dwarven researcher and explorer.\n*[[Thurgo]] - Alongside Ramarno, is supposedly the last of the [[Imcando dwarf|Imcando dwarves]].\n*[[Undor]] - A master dwarven smith who stationed at the [[Wintertodt camp]] to maintain the [[Doors of Dinh]]\n*[[Commander Veldaban]] - Commander of the [[Black Guard]], the soldiers of [[Keldagrim]].\n*[[Lady Vulcana Lovakengj]] - Leader of [[Lovakengj]] in [[Great Kourend]].\n*[[Ramarno]] - Alongside Thurgo, is supposedly the last of the [[Imcando dwarf|Imcando dwarves]].\n\n[[Category:Dwarves]]\n[[Category:Races]]\n[[Category:Guthixians]]"}

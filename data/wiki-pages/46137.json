Clicking on the link directs to a page, from which a new reply can be composed. Each reply can hold a maximum of 2000 characters.\n\nBefore posting a reply, it's possible to preview the text using the \"Preview\" button. \nIt's possible for a player to edit their own posts using the \"Edit\" link on each of their own forum posts. [[File:Mod_Stevew_hinting_quote_option_for_players.png|thumb|Mod Stevew hinting on the quote feature for players]]\n\nPreviously, quoting and formatting abilities were features that were exclusive to Jagex Moderators. As of March 2013, these features became available to all forum users. \n\n===Images===\nPlayers are able to upload images into the forums via Imgur, an image-sharing website. This feature was released on 21 July 2016.\n\n===Signatures===\nPlayers are entitled to a signature that appears on every post they make in the forums. It has a maximum of 300 characters.\n\n===Search threads===\n[[File:ForumsSearch.png|thumb|The search page with Advanced Options]]\nThe [http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/searchthreads.ws Search feature] can be used to search for a thread at the ''RuneScape'' forum through the titles.\n\nIt is possible to adjust search options at the \"Advanced search options\". E.g. to limit the search query to a specific forum section.\n\n===Jump to thread and Quick Find Code===\nEach thread is identified by a ''Quick Find Code'' (''QFC''), which is mentioned at the top and bottom of each thread. A QFC consists of digits, separated by a few hyphens, e.g.: 19-20-142-61773047\n\nAlmost every page at the forum contains a black textbox at the left upper corner of the page. Paste the Quick Find Code inside that box and click at the search button to visit the thread.\n\n===Locked, sticky, moved, and hidden threads===\n[[File:Forum highlight function.png|thumb|The forum highlighting function]]\nThe ''RuneScape'' forum is looked after by [[Forum Moderator|Forum]] and [[Jagex Moderator]]s (otherwise known as FMods and JMods). They have the ability to move, lock and hide threads. They can also change the title of the thread. Jagex and Forum moderators also have the ability to give a thread the Sticky status, which pins a thread at the top of a forum board. Jagex Moderator can also change the contents of any players post, whereas Forum Moderators cannot.\n\nNormal forum users can report accidents by pressing the 'highlight' button below a user's post in a thread and then selecting the category of the offence. For less important issues, such as a title change request, players can use the [http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/forums.ws?254,255,543,65862204 Forum Help] thread.\n\n===Forum errors===\nSometimes during maintenance or because the browser can't reach the server, an error message may appear saying: \"The Forums are temporary unavailable. The forums should be online again in 5 to 10 minutes.\" This can usually be fixed by reloading or refreshing the page.\n\n==Specialist Forums==\nThe Specialist Forums consist of several specialised, hidden forums with restricted access. They are visible only to players who have been granted access and are logged into the ''RuneScape'' website. There are several types of specialist forums:\n* Clan Leader (CLF)\n* High Level Forums (HLF)\n* Gold Premier Forums\n\n[[File:Specialist Forums.png|thumb|640px|center|Most specialist forums]]\n\n===High Level Forums===\nPlayers who have level 99 in all skills can request access to the high level forums (HLF), in which only they can read and write. In these forums, restrictions on links and images are lifted, so that the maxed players are able to communicate freely with each other and Jagex staff.\n\nThere are maxed-player versions of the General and Off-topic forums. There used to be a section for recent updates and game feedback, but they were later removed.\n\nIn order to gain access to the high level forums, a player must post in the [http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/forums.ws?254,255,436,65543568 High Level Forums - Get Access] thread in the [http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/forums.ws?254,255 Community Home] section with their title set to \"Maxed\" or \"The Completionist\". Their post will be hidden after a Jagex Mod verifies whether the player has the required levels and grants them access to the forums. Once a player gains access to the High Level Forums, they will retain it even if they don't reach level 99 in future skills when they are released.\n\n===Clan Leader Forums===\nThe clan leader forums (CLF) are accessible only to leaders of ''RuneScape'' [[clans]] which have at least 50 members and have existed for a minimum of six months. Two representatives per clan may be have access to the CLF at any one time.\n\nIn order to gain access to the clan leader forums, a player must post in the [http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/forums.ws?135,136,576,65209470 Clan Leader Forum Access] thread in the [http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/forums.ws?135,136 Clan Discussion] section. Their post will be hidden if a Jagex Mod verifies that the player's clan meets all of the access requirements and grants the two representatives access to the CLF. Players who leave their clan or whose clan disbands will retain their access to the CLF. However, a clan leader may request on the access thread that a new representative replace the other representative from their clan. This will result in the other representative having their access to the CLF revoked.\n\n===VIP Video Program (removed)===\nThe VIP Video Program forum is accessible to players who livestream ''RuneScape'' through Twitch or Youtube and email their details about their channel on either platform to [http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/forums.ws?254,255,336,65323846 Jagex]. It was previously known as Video Club in 2013. This section was removed on [[3 December]] [[2018]].{{CiteGeneral|url=https://secure.runescape.com/m=forum/sl=0/forums?278,279,424,66062131|title=Changes to the Forums.|author=Mod Meadows|date=9 November 2018|accessdate=24 December 2019|archiveurl=http://archive.is/890sn|archivedate=24 December 2019}}\n\n===Fansite Staff Forum (removed)===\nThe Fansite Staff Forum was accessible only to administrators and administrator approved members of Jagex approved fansites (bronze tier and above). There was no set limit to the number of representatives that can access the Fansite Staff Forum. It was removed on [[3 December]] [[2018]] along with the High Level - Feedback and VIP Video Program sub forums.\n\n==Criticism==\n===Spam===\nSpam has become a constant problem in the ''RuneScape'' forums, most notably in the Suggestions and Rants forums.\n\n===Compliments forum===\nThe Compliments forum has also been the subject of some criticism, even by members of Jagex staff. The reasons for this vary depending on the status of the user but generally focus on posters rarely producing anything helpful for Jagex or the community. Some members of Jagex have also stated the content of this forum is distasteful for the same reason. It was removed in 2008 but it returned in 2009. Since then, the same problems have in many ways resurfaced, and many players are pushing for Compliments and Rants to be removed.{{Fact}}\n\nOn [[16 June]] [[2011]], it was announced that the Rants forum would be removed, and the Compliments forum would stay. This led to severe ranting and spamming of the Compliments forum.\n\n===Rants forum===\nA thread requested for the Rants forum to be merged with the Compliments forum to create a Game Feedback forum (the reason being that both the Compliments and Rants forums were for feedback, but both were filled with spam). This was achieved when Jagex finally removed the Rants and Compliments forum in 2008 and replaced it with the Game Feedback forum.\n\nIn [[2009]], Mod MMG announced the re-opening of the rants forum. Upon mass amounts of spam, Jagex converted the rants forum into a sticky-only forum where people would post their issues on already existing threads. This was once again reverted and the rants forum was returned to being a forum where players could create their own threads.\n\nOn [[15 August]] [[2010]], Mod Mark H made a sticky in the Rants forum to try and stop spam and/or trolling, and later Mod Chrisso replaced it with another sticky which elaborated on the rules. Even though it hasn't completely stopped spam, trolling, or flaming, players believe that it has been somewhat effective.\n\nOn [[16 June]] [[2011]], it was announced that the Rants forum would be removed within three days. This led to many upset players spamming the compliments forum, ending in many forum bans and/or mutes. The community of rants joined together in game, starting in [[Mudskipper Point]], then [[Varrock]], then finally [[Draynor Village]], and rioted about Jagex's action.\n\nOn [[3 November]] [[2011]], the Rants forum returned as a \"hidden\" forum. This means that it is only viewable when logged into the site and invisible when not.\n\n==Post count badges==\nAs of [[30 April]] [[2015]], players can be rated with ranks and badges based on their total forum postcount. The badges can be seen from a dropdown by placing the cursor just under the player's name. The badges are cosmetic and do not unlock increased benefits or features.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

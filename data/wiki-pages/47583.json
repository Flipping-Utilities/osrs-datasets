Simply bring enough [[runes]], and turn auto cast and [[Auto Retaliate]] on.\n\nPrior to a hidden update implemented on [[10 September]] [[2015]], a player could go away-from-keyboard (AFK) until the game forced the player to log out after six hours provided the player kept their computer on and had a reliable internet connection.

As [[random event]]s did not occur in there, players could splash on another player for up to six hours, provided both players go AFK at the same time.]]\nThis was considered a cheap and effective way of [[Magic training|training Magic]] through low levels because [[experience rate]]s are based on the [[spell]] you cast rather than [[armour]]/damage bonuses, and six hours of training with [[Strike spells]] typically costs less than 40,000 [[coins]]. However, its effectiveness quickly dimishes once higher level spells are used as just a single hour of training [[Bolt spells]] can cost over 100,000 (though the XP rate is not even doubled). As no damage is dealt to your target, splashing will not give you any Hitpoints experience.\n\n==Controversy==\nSplashing was once a very popular way to train [[Magic]] after an [[Update:Optional Randoms & Goblins|update]], which made [[random event]]s optional, allowed for players to leave their avatars unattended for six hours while splashing on an [[NPC]] or another player in a safe [[minigame]] (such as [[Clan Wars]]) before the game client forced them to log out. Because of this, some players frowned upon such methods of training, even considering it cheating, although it was not against the game [[rules]].\n\nSuch controversial mechanics, which was an unintentional consequence of making random events optional, prompted [[Jagex]] to release the [http://services.runescape.com/m=poll/oldschool/results.ws?id=1154 Old School Game Integrity Survey], in which they raised multiple issues about content or activities where players believe such activities are undermining the integrity of the game, including splashing.

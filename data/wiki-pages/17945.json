The five types are ''stab'', ''slash'', ''crush'', ''magic'', and ''ranged''. [[Equipment]] gives players [[Equipment bonuses#Attack bonuses|attack bonuses]] towards and defence bonuses against each of the attack styles.\n\n==The bonuses==\nThe following are detailed descriptions of the attack bonuses:\n*'''Stab''': Stab is used primarily by [[dagger]]s, [[sword]]s, [[spear]]s, [[pickaxe]]s and [[rapier]]s. It is used as a secondary attack by [[longsword]]s, [[mace]]s, [[halberd]]s, and [[scimitar]]s. Stab is most effective against enemies wearing [[chainbody]] armour, [[leather armour]], or with heavy skin such as [[Dragon (race)|dragons]], but it isn't as effective when used against opponents with tough armour, like platebodies.\n\n*'''Slash''': Weapons that use slash as a primary attack type are [[longsword]]s, [[scimitar]]s, [[two-handed sword]]s, [[battleaxe]]s, [[axe]]s, [[abyssal whip]] and [[halberd]]s. [[Sword]]s, [[spear]]s and [[dagger]]s also use slash as a secondary attack type. Slash is best used against opponents wearing clothing or leather-based armour, or opponents with no armour at all. However, it is less effective in battles where opponent is wearing tough, usually metal [[armour]], or has scaly skin, e.g. dragons.\n\n*'''Crush''': Crush is the primary attack type when wielding [[mace]]s, [[warhammer]]s, and [[maul]]-class weapons, and is used secondarily by [[two-handed sword]]s, [[spear]]s and [[battleaxe]]s. It is also the only attack type that can be used when fighting unarmed. Crush works best against platebodies. Most small monsters, such as [[spider]]s, or hard-shelled monsters, are typically also more vulnerable to crush attacks. Crush attacks are less effective if the enemy has flexible skin/armour or is large, e.g., giants.\n\n*'''Magic''': The [[Magic]] attack type can only be used when casting offensive spells, and it is the only type that can be selected while doing so. The maximum hit of any magic spell is determined by the spell itself (only the [[Staff of the dead]], [[Kodai Wand]] and the [[Ahrim's staff]] can now increase the maximum hit of magic attacks), and the accuracy of the spell in [[PvP]] is determined by the caster's magic attack bonus, 70% of the opponent's Magic level, and 30% of the opponent's Defence level. Accuracy in [[Monster killing|PvM]] is determined by player's magic attack bonus and NPC's magic level, and NPC's magic defence bonus. Magic is very effective against metal armour, but is rarely used against opponents that deflect magic fairly easily, like [[dragonhide]] armour or [[Dragon (race)|dragons]] themselves.\n\n*'''Ranged''': The [[Ranged]] attack type hurls projectiles (typically [[Arrows]] or [[Bolts]]) at an opponent from a distance. It requires a ranged weapon, which may be different (typically a [[Bow]] or [[Crossbow (weapon)|Crossbow]]) from the projectile, although some projectiles (such as [[Throwing knife|Knives]] or [[Dart]]s) do not need a separate weapon and are wielded directly. If the weapon and the projectile are separate, the projectile is called \"ammunition.\" Ranged attacks are best used against foes that use magical attacks or are large, but are considerably less effective against enemies wearing metal armour.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Equipment bonuses]]\n*[[Combat styles]]\n\n[[Category:Combat]]"}

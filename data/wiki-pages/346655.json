If 20 is tedious, players can cut off at 16.</div></div></div>\n<p>The general strategy will use the plant layout and order in the image to the right. You do not need to use these specific patches, just any five in this pattern, though the chosen five should not be from the center three columns in order to accommodate a second person. It should be noted that using <a href=\"/w/Gricoller%27s_fertiliser\" title=\"Gricoller&#39;s fertiliser\">Gricoller's fertiliser</a> is <b>not recommended for this strategy</b>, as it speeds up the growth of the plants, and makes it impossible to handle a large number of plants. You will need eight watering cans for this strategy, or fewer depending on how many plants you do at a time. It is recommended to simply bring eight to allow flexibility in your method.\n</p><p>The optimal strategy is to grow plants in all 20 spots. This means that you only need to do five runs, and with a good connection and some practice, it is straightforward. Note that you must plant <i>and</i> water the seeds when you start a new run. The general tips outlined below provide the most benefit when you are using this strategy.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a href=\"/w/File:Tithe_Farm_Strategy_2.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/Tithe_Farm_Strategy_2.png/250px-Tithe_Farm_Strategy_2.png?e2f54\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/Tithe_Farm_Strategy_2.png?e2f54 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"300\" data-file-height=\"300\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/w/File:Tithe_Farm_Strategy_2.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>A \"zig-zag\" strategy for planting 20 seeds. Cast Humidify after harvesting the last plant.</div></div></div>\n<p>If growing 20 plants at a time is difficult due to inexperience or frequent disconnections, then it is possible to do different numbers of runs. For example, it is possible to do five runs of 17 plants followed by one run of 15 plants, or five runs of 14 plants followed by two runs of 15 plants. Regardless of how many plants you grow at once, using the given layout in the map leads to the least amount of running and thus the easiest way to manage more crops.\n</p><p>It is not recommended to grow more than 20 plants at once, as it becomes very difficult and stressful to manage more than five rows at a time. Note that when planting seeds or watering plants, you do not need to wait for the animation to finish. You can cut the time spent planting seeds or watering plants by almost half if you do this, making it one of the most important parts of managing 20 plants at once. This can take some practice to master, but as a starting point, watering plants \"finishes\" as soon as the patches of water appear, allowing you to water the next spot.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tips\">Tips</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/Tithe_Farm/Strategies?section=2&amp;veaction=edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: Tips\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/w/Tithe_Farm/Strategies?action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Tips\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Manually use the watering can on the plants the first time you water them immediately after planting. If attempting to water new plants by using left-click, there will be a delay which is not there when using the can directly on the plant. Without this, it can be stressful to grow 20 seeds at a time. After watering each plant the first time, left-clicking can be used on every other round until the fruit are harvested.</li>\n<li>Full <a href=\"/w/Graceful\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Graceful\">Graceful</a> is invaluable for this minigame. While you should not use all of your energy if you start each run at 100%, you will be able to do consecutive runs more quickly if you have full Graceful. Alternatively, <a href=\"/w/Stamina_potion\" title=\"Stamina potion\">Stamina potions</a> may help. Also, drop <a href=\"/w/Gricoller%27s_fertiliser\" title=\"Gricoller&#39;s fertiliser\">Gricoller's fertiliser</a> to save 4&#160;kg of weight before you start planting.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"/w/Humidify\" title=\"Humidify\">Humidify</a> spell from the <a href=\"/w/Lunar_spellbook\" title=\"Lunar spellbook\">Lunar spellbook</a> allows for much faster refilling of watering cans. (<b>Note:</b> This requires completion of the <a href=\"/w/Dream_Mentor\" title=\"Dream Mentor\">Dream Mentor</a> quest). You can end the spell's animation early by using a <a href=\"/w/Watering_can\" title=\"Watering can\">watering can</a> on a plant.</li>\n<li>It is a good idea to have your camera rotated to be as far above you as possible, as this makes it easier to plant seeds and water plants in adjacent spots.</li>\n<li>If using the <a href=\"/w/Farmer%27s_outfit\" title=\"Farmer&#39;s outfit\">Farmer's outfit</a>, you only need to equip it when harvesting the plants or depositing the fruit. At all other times, the graceful outfit or other <a href=\"/w/Weight-reducing_item\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Weight-reducing item\">weight-reducing items</a> should be worn. The extra experience from harvesting the fruit is very minimal (under 200 experience per hour) so don't worry if you forget to change outfits. However, the extra experience from depositing the fruit in the sack is well-worth changing outfits for.</li>\n<li>If you purchase <a href=\"/w/Gricoller%27s_can\" title=\"Gricoller&#39;s can\">Gricoller's can</a> which only needs refilling every 333 plants, you can omit the 8 watering cans and reduce your weight by several units. With level ~90+ <a href=\"/w/Agility\" title=\"Agility\">agility</a>, this is enough to wear the <a href=\"/w/Farmer%27s_outfit\" title=\"Farmer&#39;s outfit\">Farmer's outfit</a> for the duration of the minigame without the need for <a href=\"/w/Stamina_potion\" title=\"Stamina potion\">stamina potions</a>.

To accomplish this, you must be saving as many <a href=\"/w/Game_tick\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Game tick\">game ticks</a> as possible throughout all of your actions during the mini-game.\n</p><p>Since each plant spans three squares, if you are able to click to move one square diagonally before you action the next plant without losing any ticks, you save time on walking north (or south) to your next plant on that row, as it becomes only two squares away from you instead of three. This, combined with the time saved of casting <a href=\"/w/Humidify\" title=\"Humidify\">Humidify</a> while running to the first plant again (only do this right before you start on your combo route), will give you enough leeway to harvest and replant and water each plant, saving the time of running one whole route again between each harvest and replant. There is room for very few errors, as you need to continuously either be busy acting on a plant or covering distance to the next plant.\n</p><p>For the final row (plants 17-20), it can save you two extra game ticks per route if you run four squares at least two times while running to the next plant, as it consumes the same amount of time as running three squares. Keep in mind: there is an even amount of tiles between the middle tile of the 20th plant and the closest tile of the 1st plant, so there is no need to walk the extra tile to the corner of the 20th plant.\n</p><p>To practice this strategy, it is more than possible to use the general strategy by doing separate harvest and replant routes. If you apply the techniques used in this strategy to the normal strategy, you will find you can eventually \"start catching up\" to the plants you have previously watered. This can be an indication to how fast you are making your routes. \n</p><p>Generally speaking, you should always be forced to wait on the final couple of plants to grow before you can water them and move on (this only applies to watering routes <b>after</b> your first combo route, as a combo route takes more time to complete than the initial planting route). If your 11th or less plant has just grown as you begin making your way from the 20th plant back to the first, then you are able to combine your next replant and harvest routes. When you make your initial planting route, you spend less time at each plant than you do during the combo routes, so the initial plant and water may seem more click-intensive than the combo routes, but you have much more room for error.\n</p><p>Even if your plants die on the same tick in which you harvest them (if you managed to click the \"alive\" plant before it died), you will still get the fruit. So you often have one more tick than you think is remaining before you actually begin to lose any yield.\n</p><p>This method has a round-trip of 19 minutes and 30 seconds. Providing no plants die, this grants 80 points per hour and the following experience rates per hour:\n</p>\n<table class=\"wikitable\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th>Condition\n</th>\n<th>Golovanova <span class=\"scp\" data-skill=\"Farming\" data-level=\"34\"><a href=\"/w/Farming\" title=\"Farming\"><img alt=\"Farming\" src=\"/images/thumb/Farming_icon.png/21px-Farming_icon.png?558fa\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"21\" height=\"19\" srcset=\"/images/Farming_icon.png?558fa 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"25\" data-file-height=\"23\" /></a> 34 </span>\n</th>\n<th>Bologano <span class=\"scp\" data-skill=\"Farming\" data-level=\"54\"><a href=\"/w/Farming\" title=\"Farming\"><img alt=\"Farming\" src=\"/images/thumb/Farming_icon.png/21px-Farming_icon.png?558fa\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"21\" height=\"19\" srcset=\"/images/Farming_icon.png?558fa 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"25\" data-file-height=\"23\" /></a> 54 </span>\n</th>\n<th>Logavano <span class=\"scp\" data-skill=\"Farming\" data-level=\"74\"><a href=\"/w/Farming\" title=\"Farming\"><img alt=\"Farming\" src=\"/images/thumb/Farming_icon.png/21px-Farming_icon.png?558fa\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"21\" height=\"19\" srcset=\"/images/Farming_icon.png?558fa 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"25\" data-file-height=\"23\" /></a> 74 </span>\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Without <a href=\"/w/Farmer%27s_outfit\" title=\"Farmer&#39;s outfit\">farmer's outfit</a>\n</td>\n<td>28,273\n</td>\n<td>65,970\n</td>\n<td>108,380\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>With <a href=\"/w/Farmer%27s_outfit\" title=\"Farmer&#39;s outfit\">outfit</a> (on deposit only)\n</td>\n<td>28,936\n</td>\n<td>67,517\n</td>\n<td>110,921\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>With <a href=\"/w/Farmer%27s_outfit\" title=\"Farmer&#39;s outfit\">outfit</a> (on deposit and harvest)\n</td>\n<td>28,980\n</td>\n<td>67,619\n</td>\n<td>111,090\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>The only additional requirements for this method are <a href=\"/w/Humidify\" title=\"Humidify\">Humidify</a> (or <a href=\"/w/Gricoller%27s_can\" title=\"Gricoller&#39;s can\">Gricoller's can</a>) and possibly <a href=\"/w/Stamina_potion\" title=\"Stamina potion\">stamina potions</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"25x4_Method\">25x4 Method</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/Tithe_Farm/Strategies?section=4&amp;veaction=edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: 25x4 Method\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/w/Tithe_Farm/Strategies?action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: 25x4 Method\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:213px;\"><a href=\"/w/File:Tithe_Farm_25x4_Method.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/Tithe_Farm_25x4_Method.png/211px-Tithe_Farm_25x4_Method.png?e2f54\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"211\" height=\"211\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/Tithe_Farm_25x4_Method.png?e2f54 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"300\" data-file-height=\"300\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/w/File:Tithe_Farm_25x4_Method.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Tithe Farm 25x4 method route</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:206px;\"><a href=\"/w/File:Tithe_Farm_25x4_Method_alternative_route.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/Tithe_Farm_25x4_Method_alternative_route.png/204px-Tithe_Farm_25x4_Method_alternative_route.png?9894b\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"204\" height=\"211\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/Tithe_Farm_25x4_Method_alternative_route.png/306px-Tithe_Farm_25x4_Method_alternative_route.png?9894b 1.5x, /images/thumb/Tithe_Farm_25x4_Method_alternative_route.png/407px-Tithe_Farm_25x4_Method_alternative_route.png?9894b 2x\" data-file-width=\"573\" data-file-height=\"594\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/w/File:Tithe_Farm_25x4_Method_alternative_route.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Tithe Farm 25x4 method alternative route where for 40% of the time you can click the patches without clicking the ground.</div></div></div>\n<p>The 25x4 method is an alternate method to the tick-perfect strategy. This method uses a lot of the same time saving movements mentioned in the tick-perfect strategy section, but does not combine the replanting and harvesting routes into one route. Instead, this strategy uses the extra time saved to do four rounds of 25 seeds instead of the usual five rounds of 20 seeds.\n</p><p>In order to allow yourself enough time to plant 25 seeds without having any plants die, you must utilise the diagonal movements, as well as running 4 squares during the final two rows of the route (labelled plants 18-25 in the image) that are explained in the tick-perfect strategy above.\n</p><p>Both the 25x4 method and tick-perfect strategy allow players to grow 100 fruit in 16 full runs of their respective routes, including the runs to plant, water, and harvest. However, the 25x4 method requires performing actions on 25 plants per run, as compared to the 20 plants per run in the tick-perfect strategy.\n</p><p>The pros to using this method are that it is significantly faster exp and reward point gains than the general strategy (about 15%), it allows slightly more room for error than the tick-perfect strategy, it does not <i>require</i> the use of Humidify (although it is suggested to speed things up), and it allows time between each run of 25 seeds if players wish to take a break. With near perfect performance using Logavano fruit, this method allows the player to gain up to 130-140k xp/hr. It takes about 16 minutes and 40 seconds to complete 4 runs and gain 100 fruit, leading to 94-95 Tithe points gained per hour.\n</p><p>The effective difference in yield rates between this strategy and the tick-perfect strategy is dependent on how fast the player can make each planting route. In the tick-perfect strategy, you rely on being able to click the plant to harvest it, giving you time to click the seed and then use it on the empty patch without losing time. Whereas with this method, you are doing the click-intensive stuff (walking and then planting a seed without losing any ticks) for every plant, opposed to only 20 during the tick-perfect method. A test reveals that you are never standing and waiting on plants to grow with this method whereas you are <b>always</b> waiting a few seconds for the 20th plant to grow during the tick-perfect strategy. \n</p><p>If making no mistakes, the two methods are almost identical in terms of speed.\n</p><p><b>Tip:</b> When you are almost finished each harvest route, you can decide how many patches you can overlap the following run with. For example, you may find you have a few seconds to spare and can harvest your 24th plant, replant the seed and water it straight away, then move on to the 25th plant and do the same, so the 24th plant becomes the 1st and the 25th plant becomes the 2nd. <a href=\"/w/Gricoller%27s_can\" title=\"Gricoller&#39;s can\">Gricoller's can</a> is extremely helpful for doing this consistently. \n</p><p>Using this method to overlap up to 13 plants can save 50 seconds per full run, improving xp and point rates by up to 5%.\n</p>\n<div class=\"clear-template clear-both\" style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gricoller's_fertiliser_Strategy\">Gricoller's fertiliser Strategy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/Tithe_Farm/Strategies?section=5&amp;veaction=edit\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: Gricoller&#039;s fertiliser Strategy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/w/Tithe_Farm/Strategies?action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Gricoller&#039;s fertiliser Strategy\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i>Requirements: <a href=\"/w/Spade\" title=\"Spade\">Spade</a>, <a href=\"/w/Seed_dibber\" title=\"Seed dibber\">Seed dibber</a>,</i> 4 filled <i><a href=\"/w/Watering_can\" title=\"Watering can\">Watering can</a></i>\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/w/File:Gricolli%27s_Fertiliser_Path.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Gricolli&#39;s Fertiliser Path.png\" src=\"/images/thumb/Gricolli%27s_Fertiliser_Path.png/300px-Gricolli%27s_Fertiliser_Path.png?14e92\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/Gricolli%27s_Fertiliser_Path.png/450px-Gricolli%27s_Fertiliser_Path.png?14e92 1.5x, /images/thumb/Gricolli%27s_Fertiliser_Path.png/600px-Gricolli%27s_Fertiliser_Path.png?14e92 2x\" data-file-width=\"2560\" data-file-height=\"2560\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/w/File:Gricolli%27s_Fertiliser_Path.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div></div></div></div>\n<p>There are two benefits to using <a href=\"/w/Gricoller%27s_fertiliser\" title=\"Gricoller&#39;s fertiliser\">Gricoller's fertiliser</a>. The first is that it results in a much shorter period of game time between planting and harvesting. The general strategy approach requires at least 3 minutes of constant play time before harvesting. <a href=\"/w/Gricoller%27s_fertiliser\" title=\"Gricoller&#39;s fertiliser\">Gricoller's fertiliser</a> can result in a &lt; 2 min play time to harvest. It's fairly easy to plant 10 plants with the fertiliser, resulting in a fairly easy playstyle being only somewhat slower than the General Strategy method.\n</p><p>The second benefit is that <a href=\"/w/Graceful_outfit\" title=\"Graceful outfit\">Graceful outfit</a> isn't as necessary. Only 4 <a href=\"/w/Watering_can\" title=\"Watering can\">Watering cans</a> are necessary with the fertiliser, so the general player weight should be minimal. Doing only 10 plants means the majority of the travel will be walking. Using the <a href=\"/w/Farmer%27s_outfit\" title=\"Farmer&#39;s outfit\">Farmer's outfit</a> is a great alternative for this method, as this method is generally slower than the General Strategy. The overall experience difference between this strategy and the General strategy is around a 20-30% slower XP/hr rate.\n</p><p>First, the player should plant 10 seeds in the order of the image shown on the right. After the first run being dedicated to planting, the player needs to water and fertilize each plant. Water first, then fertilize, which results in the fastest method of fertilization. After the second run, the player just needs to continue watering in the order of the image until harvest.\n</p><p><b>During the harvest run, it's possible to plant the next round</b>. This requires higher focus than harvesting separately from planting. But, if done correctly, this can raise the XP/hr to close to the General strategy, although again this is likely a slower overall strategy by about 10%.\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mediawiki‐67df7655d‐7qtxl\nCached time: 20220421164448\nCache expiry: 86400\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: []\n[SMW] In‐text annotation parser time: 0.001 seconds\nCPU time usage: 0.045 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.051 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 88/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 817/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 4/100\nExpensive parser function count: 0/100\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\nLua time usage: 0.004/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 682790/367001600 bytes\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   17.337      1 -total\n 89.13%   15.453      3 Template:SCP\n  8.54%    1.481      1 Template:Clear\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key en_osrswiki:pcache:idhash:346655-0!canonical and timestamp 20220421164448 and revision id 14240060.

Always remember to have a [[spade]], [[seed dibber]] and enough filled [[watering can]]s with you for the run(s) you're about to do.\n\n'''If you are new to the minigame, it might be worthwhile try a few rounds with fewer plants (for example; 8) per run until you have gotten some practice.'''\n\n\n==General Strategy==\n[[File:Tithe Farm Strategy.png|thumb|265px|A strategy for planting 20 seeds. If 20 is tedious, players can cut off at 16.]]\nThe general strategy will use the plant layout and order in the image to the right. You do not need to use these specific patches, just any five in this pattern, though the chosen five should not be from the center three columns in order to accommodate a second person. It should be noted that using [[Gricoller's fertiliser]] is '''not recommended for this strategy''', as it speeds up the growth of the plants, and makes it impossible to handle a large number of plants. You will need eight watering cans for this strategy, or fewer depending on how many plants you do at a time. It is recommended to simply bring eight to allow flexibility in your method.\n\nThe optimal strategy is to grow plants in all 20 spots. This means that you only need to do five runs, and with a good connection and some practice, it is straightforward. Note that you must plant ''and'' water the seeds when you start a new run. The general tips outlined below provide the most benefit when you are using this strategy.\n\n[[File:Tithe Farm Strategy 2.png|thumb|250px|A \"zig-zag\" strategy for planting 20 seeds. Cast Humidify after harvesting the last plant.]]\nIf growing 20 plants at a time is difficult due to inexperience or frequent disconnections, then it is possible to do different numbers of runs. For example, it is possible to do five runs of 17 plants followed by one run of 15 plants, or five runs of 14 plants followed by two runs of 15 plants. Regardless of how many plants you grow at once, using the given layout in the map leads to the least amount of running and thus the easiest way to manage more crops.\n\nIt is not recommended to grow more than 20 plants at once, as it becomes very difficult and stressful to manage more than five rows at a time. Note that when planting seeds or watering plants, you do not need to wait for the animation to finish. You can cut the time spent planting seeds or watering plants by almost half if you do this, making it one of the most important parts of managing 20 plants at once. This can take some practice to master, but as a starting point, watering plants \"finishes\" as soon as the patches of water appear, allowing you to water the next spot.\n\n==Tips==\n*Manually use the watering can on the plants the first time you water them immediately after planting. If attempting to water new plants by using left-click, there will be a delay which is not there when using the can directly on the plant. Without this, it can be stressful to grow 20 seeds at a time. After watering each plant the first time, left-clicking can be used on every other round until the fruit are harvested.\n*Full [[Graceful]] is invaluable for this minigame. While you should not use all of your energy if you start each run at 100%, you will be able to do consecutive runs more quickly if you have full Graceful. Alternatively, [[Stamina potion]]s may help. Also, drop [[Gricoller's fertiliser]] to save 4&nbsp;kg of weight before you start planting.\n*The [[Humidify]] spell from the [[Lunar spellbook]] allows for much faster refilling of watering cans. ('''Note:''' This requires completion of the [[Dream Mentor]] quest). You can end the spell's animation early by using a [[watering can]] on a plant.\n*It is a good idea to have your camera rotated to be as far above you as possible, as this makes it easier to plant seeds and water plants in adjacent spots.\n*If using the [[Farmer's outfit]], you only need to equip it when harvesting the plants or depositing the fruit. At all other times, the graceful outfit or other [[weight-reducing item]]s should be worn. The extra experience from harvesting the fruit is very minimal (under 200 experience per hour) so don't worry if you forget to change outfits. However, the extra experience from depositing the fruit in the sack is well-worth changing outfits for.\n*If you purchase [[Gricoller's can]] which only needs refilling every 333 plants, you can omit the 8 watering cans and reduce your weight by several units. With level ~90+ [[agility]], this is enough to wear the [[Farmer's outfit]] for the duration of the minigame without the need for [[stamina potion]]s. You can reach [[Weight|0 kilograms]] by only bringing the essential weight-bearing items along with at least graceful [[Graceful cape|cape]] and [[Graceful gloves|gloves]] and also by dropping [[Gricoller's fertiliser]] upon entry as it weighs 4 kilograms.\n\n==Tick-perfect strategy==\n'''This is a click-intensive strategy which requires a bit of practice and a stable internet connection.'''\n[[File:Tithe_Farm_Tick_Perfect_Route.png|thumb|220x220px]]\nThe main difference between this strategy and the general strategy is the combination of replanting and harvesting routes into one route, by harvesting your plant, then re-planting and watering that plant before harvesting the next plant (we will call this a '''combo route'''). To accomplish this, you must be saving as many [[game tick]]s as possible throughout all of your actions during the mini-game.\n\nSince each plant spans three squares, if you are able to click to move one square diagonally before you action the next plant without losing any ticks, you save time on walking north (or south) to your next plant on that row, as it becomes only two squares away from you instead of three. This, combined with the time saved of casting [[Humidify]] while running to the first plant again (only do this right before you start on your combo route), will give you enough leeway to harvest and replant and water each plant, saving the time of running one whole route again between each harvest and replant. There is room for very few errors, as you need to continuously either be busy acting on a plant or covering distance to the next plant.\n\nFor the final row (plants 17-20), it can save you two extra game ticks per route if you run four squares at least two times while running to the next plant, as it consumes the same amount of time as running three squares. Keep in mind: there is an even amount of tiles between the middle tile of the 20th plant and the closest tile of the 1st plant, so there is no need to walk the extra tile to the corner of the 20th plant.\n\nTo practice this strategy, it is more than possible to use the general strategy by doing separate harvest and replant routes. If you apply the techniques used in this strategy to the normal strategy, you will find you can eventually \"start catching up\" to the plants you have previously watered. This can be an indication to how fast you are making your routes. \n\nGenerally speaking, you should always be forced to wait on the final couple of plants to grow before you can water them and move on (this only applies to watering routes '''after''' your first combo route, as a combo route takes more time to complete than the initial planting route). If your 11th or less plant has just grown as you begin making your way from the 20th plant back to the first, then you are able to combine your next replant and harvest routes. When you make your initial planting route, you spend less time at each plant than you do during the combo routes, so the initial plant and water may seem more click-intensive than the combo routes, but you have much more room for error.\n\nEven if your plants die on the same tick in which you harvest them (if you managed to click the \"alive\" plant before it died), you will still get the fruit. So you often have one more tick than you think is remaining before you actually begin to lose any yield.\n\nThis method has a round-trip of 19 minutes and 30 seconds. Providing no plants die, this grants 80 points per hour and the following experience rates per hour:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Condition\n!Golovanova {{SCP|Farming|34}}\n!Bologano {{SCP|Farming|54}}\n!Logavano {{SCP|Farming|74}}\n|-\n|Without [[farmer's outfit]]\n|28,273\n|65,970\n|108,380\n|-\n|With [[Farmer's outfit|outfit]] (on deposit only)\n|28,936\n|67,517\n|110,921\n|-\n|With [[Farmer's outfit|outfit]] (on deposit and harvest)\n|28,980\n|67,619\n|111,090\n|}\nThe only additional requirements for this method are [[Humidify]] (or [[Gricoller's can]]) and possibly [[stamina potion]]s.\n\n==25x4 Method==\n[[File:Tithe_Farm_25x4_Method.png|thumb|211x211px|Tithe Farm 25x4 method route]]\n[[File:Tithe_Farm_25x4_Method_alternative_route.png|thumb|211x211px|Tithe Farm 25x4 method alternative route where for 40% of the time you can click the patches without clicking the ground.]]\nThe 25x4 method is an alternate method to the tick-perfect strategy. This method uses a lot of the same time saving movements mentioned in the tick-perfect strategy section, but does not combine the replanting and harvesting routes into one route. Instead, this strategy uses the extra time saved to do four rounds of 25 seeds instead of the usual five rounds of 20 seeds.\n\nIn order to allow yourself enough time to plant 25 seeds without having any plants die, you must utilise the diagonal movements, as well as running 4 squares during the final two rows of the route (labelled plants 18-25 in the image) that are explained in the tick-perfect strategy above.\n\nBoth the 25x4 method and tick-perfect strategy allow players to grow 100 fruit in 16 full runs of their respective routes, including the runs to plant, water, and harvest. However, the 25x4 method requires performing actions on 25 plants per run, as compared to the 20 plants per run in the tick-perfect strategy.\n\nThe pros to using this method are that it is significantly faster exp and reward point gains than the general strategy (about 15%), it allows slightly more room for error than the tick-perfect strategy, it does not ''require'' the use of Humidify (although it is suggested to speed things up), and it allows time between each run of 25 seeds if players wish to take a break. With near perfect performance using Logavano fruit, this method allows the player to gain up to 130-140k xp/hr. It takes about 16 minutes and 40 seconds to complete 4 runs and gain 100 fruit, leading to 94-95 Tithe points gained per hour.\n\nThe effective difference in yield rates between this strategy and the tick-perfect strategy is dependent on how fast the player can make each planting route. In the tick-perfect strategy, you rely on being able to click the plant to harvest it, giving you time to click the seed and then use it on the empty patch without losing time. Whereas with this method, you are doing the click-intensive stuff (walking and then planting a seed without losing any ticks) for every plant, opposed to only 20 during the tick-perfect method. A test reveals that you are never standing and waiting on plants to grow with this method whereas you are '''always''' waiting a few seconds for the 20th plant to grow during the tick-perfect strategy. \n\nIf making no mistakes, the two methods are almost identical in terms of speed.\n\n'''Tip:''' When you are almost finished each harvest route, you can decide how many patches you can overlap the following run with. For example, you may find you have a few seconds to spare and can harvest your 24th plant, replant the seed and water it straight away, then move on to the 25th plant and do the same, so the 24th plant becomes the 1st and the 25th plant becomes the 2nd. [[Gricoller's can]] is extremely helpful for doing this consistently. \n\nUsing this method to overlap up to 13 plants can save 50 seconds per full run, improving xp and point rates by up to 5%.\n{{Clear}}\n==Gricoller's fertiliser Strategy==\n''Requirements: [[Spade]], [[Seed dibber]],'' 4 filled ''[[Watering can]]''\n\n[[File:Gricolli's Fertiliser Path.png|thumb]]\nThere are two benefits to using [[Gricoller's fertiliser]]. The first is that it results in a much shorter period of game time between planting and harvesting. The general strategy approach requires at least 3 minutes of constant play time before harvesting. [[Gricoller's fertiliser]] can result in a < 2 min play time to harvest. It's fairly easy to plant 10 plants with the fertiliser, resulting in a fairly easy playstyle being only somewhat slower than the General Strategy method.\n\nThe second benefit is that [[Graceful outfit]] isn't as necessary. Only 4 [[Watering can]]s are necessary with the fertiliser, so the general player weight should be minimal. Doing only 10 plants means the majority of the travel will be walking. Using the [[Farmer's outfit]] is a great alternative for this method, as this method is generally slower than the General Strategy. The overall experience difference between this strategy and the General strategy is around a 20-30% slower XP/hr rate.\n\nFirst, the player should plant 10 seeds in the order of the image shown on the right. After the first run being dedicated to planting, the player needs to water and fertilize each plant. Water first, then fertilize, which results in the fastest method of fertilization. After the second run, the player just needs to continue watering in the order of the image until harvest.\n\n'''During the harvest run, it's possible to plant the next round'''. This requires higher focus than harvesting separately from planting. But, if done correctly, this can raise the XP/hr to close to the General strategy, although again this is likely a slower overall strategy by about 10%.\n\n[[Category:Strategies]]"}

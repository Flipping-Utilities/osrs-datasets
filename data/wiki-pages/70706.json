Rollbacks within ''[[Old School RuneScape]]'' are used under very strict and rare circumstances. They are generally used to eradicate a problem that cannot be corrected by conventional methods. A rollback can also be referring to a [[Jagex Moderator]] resetting a player's stats.\n\nRollbacks have been a point of player concern, particularly the fact that items may be duplicated if a player is able to predict a rollback.\n\n==Cases of rollbacks==\nThere was a rollback on [[6 February]] [[2016]]. People reported cases of being rolled back at least 20 minutes. This was most likely due to a bug where players were finding themselves unable to log in for hours; these players got the ''Your account is already logged in'' message even though their accounts weren't logged in.\n\nThere have been various other instances of rollbacks occurring, such as during the celebration of ''Old School RuneScape''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s fifth birthday, when a [[Server|world]] crashed, presumably due to Jagex Moderators spawning too many items on the ground at once. Players were, again, unable to log in, and received the ''Your account is already logged in'' message. Once the world was restarted, players found their accounts to have been rolled back to approximately 30 minutes before the world crashed.\n\nTwo months later, on [[29 April]] [[2018]], world 343 crashed due to inadvertent third-party interference, which caused large numbers of legitimate players to log in to world 343 at the same time, as well as many items being dropped on the ground. Again, players could not log back in and were rolled back to approximately 30 minutes before the world crashed.\n\n===Coin pouch glitch===\n{{Main|Coin pouch glitch}}\nOn [[12 July]] [[2018]], an {{UD|Game Integrity: Pickpocketing|update}} introduced a glitch where stackable items would turn into 2,147,482,647 [[coin]]s, the highest possible amount a stack of items can hold. The game servers were taken offline while Jagex investigated the issue to fix it, and after approximately six hours, the game was made playable again. The servers were rolled back to the time of the update, meaning players who played between the update and the reboot would lose up to 20 minutes of progress.\n\nSome players used coins generated by the glitch to purchase [[Old school bond|bonds]] for membership. Jagex removed the illegitimately obtained membership from these accounts and players who abused this bug were temporarily banned.\n\n===Twisted bow glitch===\n{{Main|Twisted bow glitch}}\nOn [[28 February]] [[2019]], an {{UD|Bug: Twisted Bows|update}} accidentally added a [[twisted bow]] spawn by the [[Farming Guild]]. Although initially Jagex considered tracking down the bows spawned and removing them, as well as other items bought with them, the game was taken down approximately two hours after the update. The servers were rolled back to the time of the update, and the game was made online after two hours of downtime.\n\nAs with the coin pouch glitch, players who abused the glitch by purchasing bonds with wealth from the illegitimately obtained twisted bows had action taken against their account.\n\n===Sins of the Father glitch===\n{{Main|Sins of the Father glitch}}\nOn [[4 June]] [[2020]], with the release of [[Sins of the Father]], a problem occurred involving players' save states that involved items in players' equipped items and items in their inventory disappearing and being replaced by other items.

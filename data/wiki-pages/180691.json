As with many game integrity changes, this was intended to combat [[botting]].]]\n'''Game Integrity Updates''' or '''balancing changes''' are [[Polls|unpolled]] permanent changes to ''[[Old School RuneScape]]'' that are introduced to the game in order to combat rule-breaking or change elements of gameplay that are considered unfair or counterproductive to the game's long-term health. Apart from [[holiday events]], bug fixes, and minor quality of life changes, game integrity updates are the only updates not voted on by players and cannot be vetoed by the community. However, they are sometimes announced ahead of time by [[Jagex]] to take community feedback on effective ways to combat the problem without impacting the game negatively for legitimate players.\n\nOften, these unpolled updates were either perceived by the development team to be unlikely to pass a community poll or had already failed one. For example, the [[anti-dragon shield]] being gated behind the start of [[Dragon Slayer I]] failed a poll before being introduced as a game integrity update.\n\n==Examples of Game Integrity Updates==\n*[[Splashing]] was significantly reduced in effectiveness as an AFK training method when an unannounced update on [[10 September]] [[2015]] required players to interact with their client every few minutes to stay logged on, even while in combat. Splashing was later disabled in Lumbridge and its immediate surrounding area in July 2019.\n*The [[Ranged Strength]] of [[javelin]]s were reduced due to it being too powerful when paired with the [[heavy ballista]] and ranged [[Void Knight equipment]].\n*The drop table of [[Zulrah]] was majorly altered twice due to its profitability being too high.\n*Dropping items manually in the [[Wilderness]] makes it instantly visible to other players (excluding food and potions).\n*The [[coin pouch]] was introduced as an unpolled update to pickpocketing, in order to reduce the effectiveness of [[Botting|autoclicking]].\n*The use of a [[box trap]] now requires partial completion of [[Eagles' Peak]], as [[chinchompa]]s are frequently botted. In the same update, the quest was modified slightly to allow [[skill pure]]s to complete it without gaining combat experience.\n*A second floor was added to the [[Chaos Temple (Asgarnia)|Chaos Temple]] next to [[Goblin Village]] that spawns [[Wine of Zamorak]]; to access this floor, players must have either a set of [[Zamorak robes]] or [[Zamorak vestment set|Zamorak vestments]] equipped as well as [[total level]] of 500 or higher.\n*A tax was added to [[Duel Arena]] winnings in order to remove excess gold from the game, items cannot be staked and the stakes must be almost equal to combat [[real world trading]], and several countermeasures have been added to prevent [[Scams|scamming]].\n*In order to counter the falling price of [[Bird nest]]s, {{UD|Bird Nest Balancing and PvP Changes|an update}} on [[22 November]] [[2018]] modified the drop tables of [[Vorkath]], [[Zulrah]], and [[Callisto]] by removing their [[crushed nest]] drops. [[Bird house]]s also saw their yield nerfed.\n*The overhealing effect of [[Anglerfish]] was disabled in the [[Wilderness]], on [[PvP World]]s and on [[Bounty Hunter]] worlds to combat [[griefing]].\n*Purchasing [[battlestaves]] from [[Zaff]] now requires partial completion of [[What Lies Below]], in order to make it more difficult for bots to buy battlestaves en masse.\n*After extensive discussion and debate on the issue amongst both the players and Jagex, results of content polls were hidden prior to the end of the poll beginning 12 April 2019. Prior to this update, players could see a running tally of the results while the poll was still ongoing, which some argued decreased voter turnout.\n*Players can no longer trade [[pure essence]] within the [[Ourania Altar]].\n*The default special attack percentage used by the [[Granite Maul]] was increased from 50% to 60% due to it being too powerful in PvP situations.\n*[[Death's Office]] and all other current death mechanics were introduced as unpolled updates in 2020 after several player surveys.\n*A 1% tax and [[item sink]] was introduced to the [[Grand Exchange]] in December 2021 to regulate item and gold supply.\n\n{{Updates}}\n{{Timeline}}"}
